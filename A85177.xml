            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Aſſuredly, it is mater of ſome importance in this conjuncture of time, for every one of the faithful fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the Lambe, to be <hi>fellow-helpers to the Truth,</hi>

            <p>Wherefore if I ſhould altogether hold my peace at this time, as <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſaid to <hi>Hester,</hi> (and in this matter) how could I give an account with comfort to my Lord the King of Saints, when he ſhall make enquiry after the ſervice he expects ſhould be done by me in my day, for his Name and his Kingdom, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truſt he repoſed in me, <hi>when he did firſt chuſe and call me forth to ſuffer for his ſake?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I proceed to the buſineſs intended by me, I ſhall declare, ſo far as I have attained true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence in the general, the firſt and laſt occaſion of all this noiſe, both among the Churches and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and then ſubjoyne a plain-hearted explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe Truths (concerning the matter in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie) which have ſweetly wooed and won my underſtanding and judgement, (ſuch as they are) to
<pb facs="tcp:114655:4"/>entertain and to improve them, as God ſhall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially adminiſter opportunity by the teachings of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>But if in any circumſtance, I ſhould miſs the white at which I aim; it muſt be imputed to my preſent incapacity of obtaining a full Relation, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am ſtill a cloſe Priſoner (notwithſtanding my preſent breathing in the open air) and ſo cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with ſuch as would give me a more perfect and punctual Narrative in matter of fact; as alſo, becauſe there hath been, (as it was always in the like caſes) a monſtrous multiplication of new miſhapen births e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven every day.</p>
            <p>That Congregation which I am over in the Lord, ſent not many weeks ſince, an Epiſtle to me, teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their love in the Lord, and that brotherly ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with me in my ſufferings, which is meet; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, ſignifying, they ſhould rejoyce to be ſerviceable to Chriſt and me in obtaining my enlargement, if they did but once underſtand what means to uſe in order thereunto: but they could not do what their ſouls deſired to do, without owning the Powers in being; the doing of which, ſaid they, is accounted a bowing of the knee to the Image of the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>This laſt mentioned paſſage, gave me juſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to my Office, as their ſhepherd, to feed them with knowledge and underſtanding in this point, and therefore accordingly I ſpent ſome time in clearing it up unto the Congregation, in a ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle written in anſwer unto theirs.</p>
            <p>It ſeems ſome of them through <hi>anacquaintedneſs with Scripture-diſtinctions</hi> in this doctrine, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:114655:4"/>did not make a right interpretation of the Truths therein expreſſed; but miſtooke my minde and meaning, and ſo, whether weakly or willingly, divulged, or ſuffered to be divulged abroad, ſome paſſages in the Letter, which ought not to have been done, conſidering the Letter was intended for their uſe and edifying onely, and not for open publication.</p>
            <p>I had ſome hint of this in a ſhort time; but not being conſcious to my ſelf, of any alteration in the leaſt, no not in thought and purpoſe of heart, toward a compliance; and well knowing that no part of the Letter could ſignifie any ſuch thing, if rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, I neglected the rumour, as onely one of the <hi>petty ſtratagems of the devil,</hi> whereby to do me ſome miſchief.</p>
            <p>But afterward, finding that <hi>that ſecret whiſper and murmur was ripened ſuddenly into an infamous report;</hi> Letter after Letter alſo repreſenting this, as of very ſad conſequence to that Name and Cauſe for which I am bound with this Chain: I was brought under a neceſſity of preſenting to publick view the Epiſtle it ſelf, ſo far as it concerns this Cauſe;</p>
            <p>Eſpecially, when I finde it certified, that one (well known to all ſorts of people in the City) coming where ſeveral were together in company, did in a laughing and ſcoffing maner draw forth a paper, and ſay, There was my Recantation, pretending it was mine own Letter, or a Copy of it, wherein I wrote, That I was now ſatisfied, that the Government was a lawful authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears to me, that the <hi>envious One and his Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> are altogether in extreams, in their ſuggeſtions againſt my Good Name; ſometimes the world muſt
<pb facs="tcp:114655:5"/>be made believe, yea, and the Elect alſo, that I am <hi>againſt Magiſtracie and Miniſtery, that I am an enemy to Government, a moſt dangerous man in my Principles that way,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>No, bleſſed be the Lord, I ſhall not ſo far be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by him, or left to my ſelf, as to <hi>gratifie the foes,</hi> and <hi>grieve the friends</hi> of my dear Redeemer, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apoſtate after all my ſufferings in ſo good a Cauſe; <hi>HIS GRACE IS SUFFICIENT FOR HIS SERVANT:</hi> yea, let all my Friends and Enemies alſo, know aſſuredly, that I ſtand my ground by divine aſſiſtance; yea, I get ground, and am abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confirmed, that I am out of the reach of the earthly powers, inſomuch, that if they ſhould ſlay me, they could not hurt me. <hi>Let God in all things be glorified by Jeſus Christ, to whom alſo be glory for ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> The judgement of the Congregation, appears by their Letter to me, to be this: viz. That you cannot do any thing toward my enlargement (prayer excepted) without owning the Powers in Being; the doing of which, ſay you, is accounted a bowing the knee to the image of the Beaſt. Now for the better clearing up of the minde of God in this dark and doubtful matter, I ſhall plainly declare as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> Firſt, I do not know by whom the ownnig of the Powers in Being, is accounted a bowing the knee to the image of the Beaſt. It was never, neither is it like to be mine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114655:6"/>and whether you mean ſome of your Number, or of other Congregations, I cannot tell; if I had particularly known, I ſhould have given a particular Anſwer; for as for my ſelf, I do own the Powers in Being, according as God himſelf hath commanded, and have done all along: I have and do render to all their Dues; Tribute, to whom Tribute is due; Cuſtome, to whom Cuſtom; Fear, to whom Fear; Honour to whom Honour.</p>

               <label type="milestone">

            <p>By the Powers in Being, I underſtand the Army as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream, and all thoſe who joyne with them to carry on the work of juſtice, and of mercy, according to the indubitable principles of right reaſon and equity; for Rulers, ſaith the Apoſtle, are not a terror to good workes, but to the evil; and ſo far as the Powers anſwer thoſe principles, they are Powers, and the Ordinance of God, and there is no more reaſon to reſiſt them, then there is to reſiſt righteouſneſs and truth, whilſt, and ſo long as they anſwer the ends for which they were ordained; and you know, I never taught you to riſe up againſt them in the leaſt.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> But a little more to make the matter plain before you, you are to underſtand, that the Supream Powers have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, in all Ages ruled partly like men, and partly like wilde beaſts.</p>
            <p>They ruled like men, when they made, and executed, Laws agreeable to the Remainder of the image of God in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde; when they executed judgment and juſtice; when they relieved the oppreſſed &amp; refreſhed the bowels of the poor and the fatherleſs, &amp; when they made the deſolate widows hearts to ſing for joy: and many of the Heathen Kings and Rulers, will riſe up in judgment againſt thoſe, many of them, who aſſume the glorious titles of Chriſtian Kings and Princes.</p>
            <p>They ruled like wilde Beaſts, when, and ſo far as, they were Hunters like <hi>Nimrod</hi> before the Lord; when they did carry matters by force and violence, by fire and ſword to ſatisfie their own luſts; when they degenerated into cruel Tyrants; (which are monſters in Government) And ſo, their Wills gave Law to millions of people better and more righteous then themſelves.</p>
            <p>The holy Spirit doth more then intimate this diſtinction in Daniel very excellently, by comparing the four Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, or Supream Powers, to the image of a man, <hi>Dan. 2.</hi> and then afterward the ſelf-ſame Monarchies, every one of them to a cruel wilde Beaſt, <hi>Dan. 7.</hi> from whence I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they did and would be found to govern the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſome reſpects like men, that is, according to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of right reaſon and righteouſneſs. And thus far they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114655:7"/>had the ſuperſcription and image of God upon them, and were to be ſubmitted to, as the Ordinance of God. But in other reſpects, and at other times, they did live like ſo many wilde Beaſts, and ſo the Spirit of God calls them Lions, and Bears, and ravening Wolves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Courts being fill'd with the ſpoil of the people, to maintain them in their pomp, pride and luxury; their wanton and beaſtly Courts, I ſay, were, and are ſupported, and maintained out of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Taxes, which by illegal wayes and means they did and do ſtill tear out of the bowels of the oppreſſed people.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> Beſides this, there is another Obſervation very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: for where as the holy Spirit, repreſents the four Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies put together in <hi>Dan. 2.</hi> by one onely image of a man: He doth in <hi>Dan. 7.</hi> repreſent the four Monarchies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by four ſeveral cruel Beaſts; which to me ſignifies thus much, that in the chief Rulers and Governours of this world, there would be found at the leaſt four times as much and more, of the nature and ſpirit of wilde beaſts, then of the nature and ſpirit of mankinde, or the reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And indeed this is not onely ſignified in this prophecie, but it is plainly manifeſted in the Hiſtories of all Ages, and of all Nations, from <hi>Daniel</hi>'s time unto this day. And for this Nation, I dare venture to make it good with the utmoſt peril of my life, that the ſpirit of the fourth Beaſt is yet living and acting its part in <hi>England,</hi> contrary to the Principles, Rules, and Preſidents of <hi>common honeſty,</hi> of <hi>the light of nature,</hi> and <hi>of the Laws of all Nations,</hi> which are not bruitiſh and barbarous.</p>
            <p>And againſt this ſpirit I am engaged more and more, not againſt the man in man; for that is to engage againſt God and his Ordinance; but againſt the Beaſt and his image in man: and in this enterpriſe, the Lord will ſtand by me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Kings of the earth, if I could come at them to preach againſt their beaſtly abominations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> But to conclude this: where as you ſay in effect you cannot be ſerviceable to Chriſt and me in reference to my enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without owning the Powers in being; unleſs I have ſome way to offer to you, which may be conducible to that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114655:7"/>end; I have this onely to ſay, that when I did read this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, three or four wayes came into my minde, wherein it was honourable for you to appear, without any danger of bowing the knee to the image of the beaſt; but yet I would not have you expect, that I ſhould ſhew you any one of them; for I hope the Lord will help me, to cut off occaſion from them that ſeek occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I have my end which I propounded in this matter, and ſhall wait on the Lord: for, I aſſure you here before him, in the midſt of you, I do not yet begin to be weary of mine Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, nor yet to yield; although ſome of the Lords people are more apt to think and ſay ſo, then there is ground ſo to think or ſay. And my Meſſage, as you call it, did not ſignifie any thing of that nature, but had another meaning.</p>

            <p>And as Chriſt ſaid to the mourning Women, Daughters of Jeruſalem, weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves, and for your children: ſo I ſay in the ſame ſpirit, Were I now going to the ſcaffold, be not ſad for me, ye ſons and daughters of Sion, but be ſad for your ſelves and for your families, for great diſtreſs is coming towards you; and yet to others, I may ſay, Look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh. And great ſhall their comfort be, who can finde in their heart to deny themſelves, and to forſake all, for the Lord Jeſus. But ſuch Diſciples are very rare; and time will give us yet a more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful demonſtration thereof.</p>

               <p>Which Goſpel-perrection,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.11, 12, 13.</note> was one great end of Chriſt his giving the gifts of the Spirit unto his Churches.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I being (as <hi>Paul</hi> in his,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.14.</note> ſo I in my Line) a debtor to the wiſe and to the unwiſe, it is not meet I ſhould be blamed for paying the due debt of my Office, which I owe to the whole flock of Chriſt (whereof I am made the Overſeer) by manifold obligations.</p>
               <p>But to put a period to this Section; I anſwer further, that I had a particular call to ſpeak largely to this point a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Governments, becauſe I perceived the Church or ſome particular perſons to be under a great miſtake, even neer of kin to a groſs abſurdity, (and one abſurdity being granted, a thouſand will follow.) Now it is required and expected by the Lord Jeſus and his people, that I ſhould endeavour at leaſt to guide their feet into the way of truth,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114655:9"/>when I perceive them but begin to go aſtray. And as for the unſeaſonableneſs of handling ſuch kinde of doctrine, conſidering, as is urged, there is ſo great need of healing, and of ſilencing all debates about Powers; and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer further, It was never the cuſtom of the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, nor of the Prophets before them, to inquire which way the winde did blow at the Kings Court, but to promote and to perfect their Lord's work, which he had given them to do, while it was called to Day: for when the night cometh, no man can work.</p>
               <p>That alſo of <hi>Solomon</hi> is ſuitable to this purpoſe:
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.4.</note> 
                  <hi>He that obſerveth the winde ſhall not ſow, and he that regardeth the clouds ſhall not reap.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And to ſpeak the Truth to the glory of my Lord, my not regarding any mans Perſon or Power when I am about his buſineſs, and my not taking care at any time for this twenty yeers to pleaſe men, but onely God, which trieth the hearts, hath been to me of very refreſhing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and remembrance upon all pertinent occaſions, ever ſince I was bound with this chain; as it is alſo at the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hereof, as I am here ſitting before the Lord, <hi>to plead for truth with paper and ink,</hi> ſeeing I cannot, to this day, hear any tidings of <hi>meeting with my Accuſers face to face.</hi>

               <p>Thus I plead my cauſe againſt the falſhood and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous dealing of ſuch ſlanderers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Is it not a moſt abſurd and irrational method of proceeding againſt our neighbour, to tear aſunder thoſe words and ſentences, which the <hi>writer</hi> had put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo to undermine his good Name among his friends, and to render him the by-word of his foes? and, which is worſe then both the other, to trample upon that noble Cauſe which God himſelf hath call'd forth the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> to maintain &amp; bear witneſs to before the world? The Heathens would abhor ſuch ſpirits and ſuch practiſes, when brought before them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In caſe thoſe paſſages had been written darkly and doubtfully, was it not the duty of the Reader or Reporter, or both, to make the beſt interpretation, (now, let con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience do its office) which Chriſtian love could give, and moſt ſutable to the declared and known principles of the Author of thoſe words? unleſs he had certain information, or other teſtimony of his open apoſtacy from his profeſſion and conſtant converſation in time paſt unto that day.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:114655:10"/>
               <p>Wherefore thirdly, Let the whole clauſe be conſidered with an honeſt and impartial minde, and you will finde ſuch cautelous qualifications ſuperadded, as if I had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen the Devils deſign againſt the Cauſe and the Perſon both. Whereas I writing in ſimplicity of heart, as in the ſight of God, <hi>without any thoughts of Declining or Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back</hi>

               <p>The firſt <hi>Qualification</hi> of my Words, was this: AC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CORDING AS GOD HIMSELF HATH COMMAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DED, <hi>I do own the Powers in being, and have done all along:</hi> but otherwiſe I never did, nor ſhall, own the preſent Powers, or their ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Qualification</hi> of thoſe Words of mine, which I added in the cloſe of this third <hi>Section,</hi> is expreſſed in the words of the Apoſtle, Rendering to all their Dues, tribute to whom tribute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as you read it, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7.</p>
               <p>And thus far in this third <hi>Section,</hi> and no further, have I indeavoured to ſtate the caſe, and to plead againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable carriage of that perſon, or thoſe perſons, who have given liberty to their tongues, to ſpeak reproachfully againſt their neighbour <hi>without cauſe,</hi>

It ſeems it is the onely work of God to tame it, it is not mans work; eſpecially when it is ſet on fire from Hell, as too too often it comes to paſs. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>Now further, to declare ingenuouſly my judgement and apprehenſions in this point, thus I ſay:</p>
               <p>Either I muſt own the Powers <hi>in Being, or that Are,</hi> (for we will not argue about expreſſions, when they are well underſtood, though they may not be very proper,) I ſay, either I muſt own the <hi>preſent Powers,</hi> or I muſt own <hi>Anarchy.</hi> For Powers to be hereafter, or which may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114655:10"/>in time to come, I know not how to own in ſuch a ſence as I intended; (for <hi>de non apparentibus &amp; non exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus eadem eſt ratio,</hi>) If the Powers do not appear, and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtere extra cauſas,</hi> as we ſay, it is all one to us, as if they were not <hi>in rerum naturâ,</hi> as indeed they are not actually, till they are formed; (for <hi>forma dat nomen &amp; eſſe</hi>) and ſo exiſt from the concurrence of the ſeveral efficient cauſes alſo, reſpectively.</p>
               <p>Now as for <hi>Anarchy</hi> or <hi>no Government;</hi> for a people to have no Powers in being, it is Confuſion, it is Deſolation, it is the Abomination of Deſolation, or that maketh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate. It alwayes was, it is, it will ever be the Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of my ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tyranny</hi> it ſelf is not ſo ugly a monſter by many Degrees, in mine eyes, as is
<note n="*" place="margin">I underſtand Anarchy not in notion, but in operation; Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy Rampant.</note> 
                  <hi>Anarchy.</hi> But let no man imagine, that I ever was, or now am, a friend in the leaſt to <hi>former</hi> or <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Tyranny,</hi> though I thus ſpeak: for Tyranny is High Treaſon againſt Mankind, and againſt the Image of God in the world, and ſhall be turned headlong off from the ſtage again, when it hath acted its part, for the accompliſhment of the Counſels of the Almighty; <hi>which will not be, until the words of God ſhall be fulfilled,</hi> as it is written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid, the Saints and the World may ſee, what reaſon I had, and have, to declare that I DO OWN THE POWERS IN BEING; for, to own the Powers that are to be hereafter, (but are not yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant) I cannot do it, <hi>viz.</hi> in that ſence before expreſſed; and own <hi>Anarchy,</hi> or <hi>non-Government,</hi> that I will not do upon any terms, while by the grace of God I continue in my right minde, and injoy any remainders of ſenſe and reaſon. So that we are conſtrained by right reaſon to own the preſent Powers.</p>
               <p>But then withal, my two <hi>Limitations, Reſtrictions,</hi> or <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectives,</hi> (call them what you pleaſe) muſt be admitted and remembred carefully, for otherwiſe I ſhall ſuffer apparent injury, as lately I have felt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in general, I told the Congregation, <hi>I owned them according to God,</hi> or <hi>as God himſelf hath commanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:114655:11"/>
               <p>Secondly, I did particularly declare, <hi>how, and how far I owned the Powers in being,</hi> in ſaying, <hi>I gave tribute, cuſtom, fear and honor, where each of theſe were due: BUT WHAT, AND WHO THOSE POWERS ARE, IN MY OPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NION, IS ANOTHER QUESTION, AND SHALL BE HANDLED IN ITS PLACE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe two <hi>Reſtrictions,</hi> I explain my meaning thus. I may as well throw away the Old and New Teſtament, thoſe bleſſed Oracles (which are ſweeter to me (eſpecially ſince I came into priſon, and, yet more eſpecially, ſince I was ſhut up in Cloſe-Impriſonment,) then the honey or the honey-combe) as deny, or refuſe to own the Powers in Being, it being ſo Juſt and ſo Good a Law of God

               <p>But moreover, let us not interpret this ſubjection and obedience, this owning of them, to be <hi>Abſolute and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited,</hi> as if without all <hi>Reſtrictions</hi> and <hi>Diſtinctions;</hi> for that were unreaſonable; as hath been argued and urged againſt the <hi>late King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea furthermore, theſe things are injoyned to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſtians, and private perſons, who are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Authority; for otherwiſe, <hi>one Higher power, may refuſe obedience to another Higher power, yea, and take their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity away from them utterly, and for ever, in many caſes,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew afterward.</p>
               <p>But to give the world an Account of my Principles and Practiſes in this point. Yet more particularly,</p>
               <p>I am bound to own them ſo, as not to forget that I am a Diſciple of Chriſt, &amp; that the Goſpel &amp; the Doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to guide and regulate me in the thing under conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; for though they are the Higher Powers, yet not the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114655:11"/>Higheſt, FOR THERE ARE HIGHER THEN THEY.
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.8.</note> And if at any time they command ought, that is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Commands of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Mat. 28.18.</note> 
                  <hi>who hath all power in heaven and earth,</hi> and with that duty and Evangelical Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance which I owe and bear to him, I ſhall diſown them ſo far, and their commands alſo, before their faces and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde their backs, (as the phraſe uſed by the New-Court-flatterers doth expreſs it) and yet ask no queſtion for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, there being no ſcruples upon my ſpirit in this matter, as afterward I ſhall ſhew.</p>
               <p>I alſo humbly conceive, that thoſe Chriſtians who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir, and ſuffer patiently under the penalties which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on them for chuſing to obey God, rather then man, (as it is my preſent Caſe) do as really own the powers, as any of thoſe who yield active Obedience to what is injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to do: for they fulfil and anſwer the Law herein, whether it be <hi>the Law of the Land,</hi> that impoſeth ſuch a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty in caſe of diſobedience (as the world calls it) or the <hi>Law of their own wills and Luſts onely,</hi> who are the <hi>Supream Powers</hi> at that time.</p>
               <p>For the underſtanding hereof, we are to know, that every Command whatſoever among men, (whether it proceed from <hi>rational and juſt power,</hi> or from <hi>arbitrary power,</hi> and a wilful will void of reaſon) doth conſiſt of two parts, the <hi>preceptive part,</hi> and the <hi>punitive part;</hi> for I dare affirm,
<note place="margin">Precepts and Penalties are the proper ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of all Laws.</note> that no Law-makers, will give out Commands or Laws, and then leave it to the people, whether to obey or not obey; in reaſon, a penalty is to be annexed and executed, in caſe of refuſal to give due obſervance; and every one muſt either do what is injoyned in the <hi>preceptive part of the Law,</hi> or elſe <hi>ſuffer</hi> what ſhall be <hi>inflicted:</hi> I ſpeak of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and under Authority.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe Saints who, <hi>for conſcience ſake,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.5. 1 Pet. 2.13.</note> and <hi>for the Lords ſake,</hi> do willingly and out of choice ſuffer Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Confiſcation of Goods, Baniſhment, or Death, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>ſin againſt Chriſt,</hi> may be properly ſaid to own the Powers in Being, as really, and more honeſtly, and acceptably before God, then thoſe who are moſt forward
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114655:12"/>to yield active obedience at the ſame time, to the ſame law.</p>
               <p>But becauſe familiar examples will help to illighten the ordinary Reader, for others need them not, I ſhall illuſtrate this doctrine and my practiſe, in owning the higher powers, by one famous example in the word of Truth.</p>
               <p>It is that of the third of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 3.4, 5, 6.</note> a moſt excellent Hiſtory of three of the Old Teſtament-worthies, and their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The <hi>Higher Power</hi> in being makes <hi>a Law,</hi> (or a thing like a Law,) <hi>TO YOU IT IS COMMANDED, O PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE, NATIONS, AND LANGUAGES, AT SUCH AN INSTANT OF TIME, TO FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP THE GOLDEN IMAGE WHICH THE KING OR EMPEROUR HATH SET UP.</hi> This is the ſum of the firſt part of the Law.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part is to this effect: <hi>WHOSOEVER WILL NOT FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP, SHALL THE SAME HOUR, WHEN HE REFUSETH, BE TOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTED BY FIRE, AND BURNT TO DEATH.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to me it appears plainly, that <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> patiently ſubmitting to the Kings pleaſure, and the proclaimed penalty, without any reſiſtance, did <hi>fulfil the Law</hi> aforeſaid in the <hi>later part of it,</hi> as really as the Nations and Languages did <hi>fulfil or perform the firſt part of it;</hi> and conſequently did therein own the Powers in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>This plain Syllogiſm, will put it out of controverſie.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Thoſe who willingly ſubmit to the Laws of the Higher Powers which are in their dayes, may truly be ſaid to own thoſe Powers.</item>

               <p>Thus you ſee how the Diſciples indured a <hi>very heavy yoke of bondage,</hi> even in that period of time, when the fourth Beaſt was moſt tame and moſt gentle, namely, in Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> time and reign.</p>

<note place="margin">The Scotiſh oppoſition to the Prelates and their trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, a door of hope opened to the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saints.</note> was ready to be deſpiſed, as not having any great birth in the womb of it.

               <p>But the Spirit of Chriſt riſeth higher and higher in his Servants, being incouraged by the high Court of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe Office it was to take an account of the grievances and oppreſſions which had made the people full of diſcontent againſt the waies of the Court, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally againſt the Prelates.</p>

               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>But it may be further urged by others, But particular Chriſtians did go to Law with the King, before the Parlament was called, and ſo oppoſed him that way, by Arguments drawn from Reaſon and Juſtice, as Mr.</hi> Hampden, &amp;c. <hi>and cannot you go and do thus likewiſe? namely, wage Law with your Oppreſſors.</hi>

               <p n="2">2 If the Sword were not the ſupreme Power, and if all the Laws were not ſilenced (or ſuſpended at leaſt) which are againſt that Sword-intereſt, It may be ſome particular perſons, whom God ſhould make free, might dare to wage or plead the Law of the Land againſt their oppreffors, or appeal to the higher Powers (if there were any as high or higher than the ſharp power of the Sword) <hi>as</hi> Paul <hi>did from the Jewiſh Powers unto</hi> Auguſtus;

               <p>
                  <hi>Cranmer</hi> appealed from the Power in being, which oppreſſed him, to the next <hi>General Council,</hi> whch was a Power in ſome ages had in great veneration, but what good could that do him? the preſent Power burnt him to aſhes, and his <hi>Appeal to a future contingent Power</hi> dyed with him; yet it was a kind of Teſtimony againſt his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors.</p>
               <p>And if that be judged to be of any uſe upon Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, I can enter my Appeal to the next higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114655:27"/>which the God of Heaven ſhall ſet up in mercy, and love to his poor Remnant, to do us right, and deliver us from our potent perſecuters.</p>
               <p>But as the caſe now ſtands, I am made a Bond-ſlave, who was born free, and never forfeited my liberty (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the Lord, I can ſpeak it before men and devils) by any tranſgreſſion of mans Laws; yet I have, and do cheerfully, and with great delight, ſubmit to the will of God, in theſe ſufferings, ſo burthenſome to fleſh and blood; and I am perſwaded, if they ſhould ſcourge me as the Jews did the Apoſtles, and as the Prelats did ſome under the former Monarchs, <hi>I ſhould rejoyce to be counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his name
<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 5. laſt verſ.

               <p>Now as touching the other two particulars,
<note place="margin">Honor and Fear due to Higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as Tribute and Cuſtom is due unto them</note> 
                  <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> which are to be given to <hi>the Higher Powers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide <hi>Tribute</hi> and <hi>Cuſtome;</hi> In a very few words, this I have to ſay, That I alwayes freely gave honor to whom honor was due.</p>
               <p>And in particular, when I was apprehended the firſt time, namely, about the 21. of the 10. Month, 1653. and brought before the Council, for expounding the Prophecie about the little Horn in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. I did obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance according to the cuſtome of the Country, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which I live, uſed towards Superiours, I ſtood while they ſat, and with my head uncovered, the General having his hat on, and this without reluctancy; beſides, I freely gave him the honorable Title of a Lord, in diſcourſe with him, as being Captain General of all the Forces; and I ſuppoſe this is to <hi>own a Higher Power,</hi> for thoſe who do not own Government and Superiority among men, do not ſo behave themſelves, as namely the Shakers, as they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114655:27"/>call them, or any others of thoſe principles; and thus I did to the Committee of the Council, when I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and brought before them this ſecond time; and I do not remember that ever any Powers did challenge me in this matter.</p>
               <p>As for Fear, and the <hi>rendring of fear to whom fear is due,</hi> I am of this perſwaſion, that if I were guilty in mine own conſcience, and before the Lord, of any ſuch groſſe wickedneſſe, as ſome of the choiſeſt Saints have been overtaken, and overcome withall, and were brought to a legal trial, and convicted by witneſſe without, as well convinced by witneſſe within, I ſhould be afraid of the Power, but not otherwiſe; For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Wilt thou not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good; but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid;</hi> ſo that in this alſo, I am ready to own any Higher Powers which ſhall be ſet up in my dayes, when there is occaſion and reaſon for it; and ſurely no man can ſay (at leaſt if his words have the ſap and juyce of ſenſe and reaſon in them) <hi>that I ought to fear any power, higher, or lower, unleſſe when I have done evill,</hi> and this be made known unto me in the light of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Law of God. But, though I know nothing by my ſelf, yet I am not thereby juſtified in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>Thus I have (for the Cauſe ſake, which might ſuffer, if I ſhould have neglected this impudent ſlander) freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my <hi>former and preſent principles</hi> concerning the <hi>Powers in being;</hi> But who could have imagined, firſt, That in ſaying, I owned the preſent powers, I had recanted; and ſubmitted, and acknowledged them to be a lawful Authority, and an hundred falſe rumors, to the grief of my brethren, of the ſame ſpirit with me in the preſent Truth? whereas I never ſaid nor thought otherwiſe. And who could have imagined ſecondly, that any one who calls and accounts himſelf a Chriſtian, would take part of the letter, or a few ſentences here and there torn from the reſt, and thereupon divulge and ſhew them as a teſtimony and proof of ſuch a Report? whereas, to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114655:28"/>recapitulate all in a word, This is that I will cloſe up this Section with.</p>
               <p n="1">1 I acknowledge, there are <hi>Higher Powers</hi> in being, and every one muſt grant this, as well as I, and my Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoners; for they feel it, I beleeve, though not ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually as we do.</p>
               <p n="2">2 I yeelded my body to be apprehended and carried away, without ſtriving or lifting up my voyce in the ſtreets, when they ſent their Meſſengers with ſwords (and it may be other weapons about them) to bring me before the Council. And I reckon this to be an owning of the preſent powers. I never did yeeld thus far to private men, who ſhould come to apprehend me, in my houſe, or otherwhere; I were bound to ſtand upon my guard in ſuch a caſe, as men do every day againſt Theeves and Robbers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

This moſt High God divided to the Nations their Inheritance, <hi>Deut,</hi> 32.8. and the firſt ground, and as it were, Catholique Dominion, was given to the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians;</hi> the next, to the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians;</hi> The third, to the <hi>Macedonians</hi> or <hi>Grecians;</hi> The fourth, to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Theſe four ſucceſſively, each in their times, according to the All-wiſe appointment of the will of God, were Lords of the world, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. The people of God were not free from theſe yokes of bondage, as you have read already in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Section.</p>

                  <hi>Prop.</hi> or <hi>Obſer.</hi> 3. The Roman Monarchy, the laſt of the four Kingdoms (or Beaſts, as the Spirit of God
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114655:33"/>doth expreſly call them) was at its full growth or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> about the time of the birth of the Prince of the Kings of the earth,
<note place="margin">Numb. 24.17.</note> juſt at the Meridian of the Roman glory, did the Star of <hi>Jacob</hi> ariſe and ſhine, but with a very dim light to the ſight of the world, for yet he had not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted forth his glory, as afterward he did, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.11. This is plain, as from other Hiſtories, ſo from <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.7 firſt verſes, Where all the world, you find, was to be taxed by the Decree of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> who now was in peaceable poſſeſſion of the Roman Empire (<hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus</hi> being overcome) The Kingdom of Heaven, it ſeems, which ſhall break in peeces all theſe Kingdoms, was deſigned to be ſet up at that inſtant conjuncture of time, when this Monarchy was grown to its full perfection. But more of this in due time and place, if the Lord ſo pleaſe.</p>

To this Beaſt, there deſcribed, the Dragon gives his Power or Hoſt, his Throne, and great Authority, and ſo proſecutes, on the behalf of the Dragon, the old trade of deceiving the Nations, and perſecuting the Saints of the moſt High; eſpecially, he falls upon thoſe in every age, who are zealous conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the preſent truth of every age, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.</p>

Theſe North-weſt Nations are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſome of thoſe ten Horns, which have given their power and ſtrength to the Beaſt, to make war with the Lamb and his followers. And the evidence of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy and Hiſtory is ſo ſtrong in this particular, that all the Proteſtant Interpreters, whom I have converſed with,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114655:33"/>do agree in this Truth, That the Race of Kings in this Iſland, have, together with the other Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, and given their Kingdom to the Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.13. and whether it be wholly taken from him again, I mean, in this Nation, to this day, is worthy a grave and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous examination.</p>

Now more particularly, King <hi>Charls</hi> was within the compaſs of theſe Prophecies, for he was not for the ſetting up of the Kingdom of Chriſt, No, not ſo much as in appearance or pretence, much leſs in heart. The ſpirit of the fourth Beaſt was plainly to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in him by thoſe who were wiſe, and had their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſenſes at their right hand: For the wiſe ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, faith <hi>Daniel,</hi> but none of the wicked ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.

               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> or <hi>Obſer.</hi> 7. This King <hi>Charles</hi> was fourteen or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years ſince acknowledged an Higher Power in theſe Nations, being in quiet poſſeſſion of the beſt Title to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and to Rule the people, of any other. But the Decrees of the moſt High, for this age, being to take place, he was neceſſitated to call a Parlament, and to give it an exiſtence in conjunction with the free people of the Nation, they being the two legal efficient cauſes thereof. So, here was another Higher Power in being, ſent by him and the people (as the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth the Powers) according to the known Law of the Land. This we have heard and ſeen, and it was, and is ſtill, marvellous in our eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> or <hi>Obſer.</hi> 8. This ſecond Higher Power, as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, did contend with him who helped to make them a Power, and to give them their lawful exiſtence in that capacity. This power, after many bloody conflicts, by their Forces, did take away his Dominion, to conſume and to deſtroy it to the end; then there was, we thought, an end of Kingſhip, and this ſecond Power declared themſelves the Supreme Authority of the Nation, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Government from the notion of King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, into that of a Commonwealth: This was a great
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114655:34"/>and wonderfull work of God, which we are to conſider with great regard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> or <hi>Obſer.</hi> 9. This Higher Power (now ſupreme) had impowred and Authorized (after the <hi>Eſſexian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was not found a fit Inſtrument for the work) the new modeld Army, and ſo they became a ſecond high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Power in the Nation alſo, ſent by the Parlament, as the Parlament was ſent by the King and People; But yet, and for a good ſpace, they were, and they acted, as ſubordinate to the Supreme Civil Authority: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, in proceſs of time, after moſt admirable Viciſſitudes, this military, ſubordinate higher Power, did take away the Parlaments Dominion, to confume, and to deſtroy it to the end. I ſay, they pluckt up the ſupreme Power (ſo owned by themſelves) by the very roots, even as they had eradicated Monarchy, and damned it for ever, as much as in them lay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> or <hi>Obſer.</hi> 10. Hereupon, no Antient, Legal, Civil higher Power, or ſupreme Authority, was in being; And, that there might be a total deſtruction or diſſolution of the old Fabrick to the foundation, yea, of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and all, The Souldiers took upon them to ſet up an Aſſembly, ſomewhat like a Parlament, which by major Vote called themſelves by that name (but how impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, not to ſay ridiculouſly, let Law and Cuſtom ſpeak; for neither King nor people did put forth any cauſal vertue towards their production, as by Law they ought) But to be ſhort, the Souldiery quickly pulled them down again, like King <hi>Charles,</hi> who by his Prerogative, when the Parlament had no mind to humor his luſts, would diſſolve them at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Thus you, by this time, do not onely underſtand that they are ſupreme, as I aſſert, but you ſee, <hi>quibus viis &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> by what waies and means they are gotten into the Throne. Now, can any Chriſtian, nay, can any rational Creature find fault with me for obſerving theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous works of the great Jehovah? Can they find in their hearts to be angry with me for calling aloud to all
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114655:34"/>the Saints (and others too, if they had ears to hear) in <hi>Davids</hi> words, <hi>Come, behold the works of the Lord, what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations he hath made in the earth,</hi> Pſal. 46.8. and as he cries out Pſal. 66.57. <hi>Come and ſee the works of God; he hath been terrible, he will be more terrible in his doing toward the children of men; He ruleth by his power for ever, his eies behold the Nations. Let not the rebellious EXALT THEMSELVES, Selah. Whoſo is wiſe, and will obſerve theſe things, even they ſhall underſtand the loving kindneſs of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 107.43.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen, we have ſeen an end of all perfection, which hath been preſerved for ſo many ages. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and power of a King, and <hi>the Son of antient Kings, is cut down, and coſt out as an abominable Branch,</hi> the Privilege of Parlament, the Parlament, and all their numerous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Privileges pulled down, and devoured by the Army at a Breakfaſt; the Liberties of the people alſo have met with the ſame deſtiny; thus this <hi>antient three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Cord,</hi> made and preſerved by our Anceſtors, with ſo much care, with ſo great coſt of blood and treaſure, is utterly untwiſted and broken all to peeces.</p>
               <p>By this brief account of theſe <hi>aſtoniſhing Alterations,</hi> that great Truth which I laid as the firſt ſtone, and the corner ſtone of this Diſcourſe, is worthy of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; <hi>The moſt High ruleth in the Kingdom of Men, He changeth the times and the ſeaſons, He removeth Kings, and ſetteth up Kings, He the Lord doth all theſe things;</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wonders without number. <hi>His works are honorable and glorious, ſought cut of all that have pleaſure therein,</hi> Pſal. 111.2, 3.</p>
               <p>Thus, according to that talent of underſtanding which is given to me, in theſe great and ſtrange <hi>tranſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Powers</hi> by the effectual influence of the firſt cauſe, according to the words of the Prophets (Kingly Power, Ariſtocratical Privilege, and Democratical Liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolved, deſtroyed and diſanulled, as you have read, heard, and ſeen) the <hi>Army</hi> muſt needs be the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Higher Power</hi> within theſe Nations; If any Man, Lawyer, Stateſ-man, &amp;c. know <hi>a Higher Power</hi> than
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114655:35"/>theirs, a <hi>ſtronger power</hi> than theirs, <hi>a more abſolute power</hi> than theirs, I would willingly hear him ſpeak his mind in that particular.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, if it be obſerved, I only ſay, They are the <hi>Supreme Power,</hi> without addition, or determination what kind of Power; I own them as an <hi>Higher,</hi> as the <hi>Higheſt earthly Power, de facto,</hi> acting and exerciſing ſuch a ſuperiority over the people; but <hi>quo jure,</hi> that is another Queſtion, fitter for the Lawyers to plead, if they would or Durſt, than for me; yet, this I can find ground to ſay, If any one ever heard me ſay they were a <hi>lawfull Authority,</hi> or, as is ſuggeſted, If any perſon whatſoever can produce any writing, wherein I acknowledge them a <hi>lawful,</hi> or <hi>legal Authority,</hi> ſince the 16. of the 10. Month, 1653. let them publiſh it to the world, and I will ingenuouſly confeſſe, I am no way able to mantain or juſtifie ſuch an Aſſertion in the leaſt; let them that pleaſe exerciſe their wits to perſwade the credulous; For, <hi>Nibil tam incredibile, quod non, dicendo, fiat probabile,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> faith.</p>
               <p>I ſhall, according to the duty of my Office, declare from the good word of God, what is there upon record, for a teſtimony againſt that generation of Back ſliders from the Cauſe of Chriſt, whom theſe following truths, either do now, or may hereafter very much concern.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures of Truth do give us much light in the matter under conſideration.

This is alſo plain to ſenſe and reaſon. I ſhall not trouble the Reader further with this, ſo I put it firſt, to diſpatch it, unleſſe I meet with an oportunity to do further ſervice with this diſtinction.</p>
               <p>As for the ſeveral kinds of Higher Powers, that alſo needs little explication. In ſome Nations there is <hi>one kind,</hi> in others <hi>another kind,</hi> Kings, Judges, Elders, Patriachs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:114655:35"/>But there is alſo a <hi>Diſtribution of Powers</hi> by their <hi>Adjuncts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diſtributio ſubjecti in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncta.</note> and ſo the <hi>Powers that are,</hi> are either <hi>Lawful</hi> or <hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lawful Higher Powers</hi> are ſuch, either from <hi>God,</hi> or from <hi>Nature,</hi> or from <hi>Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>God,</hi> either firſt, by <hi>eſpecial Deſignation, in love and mercy</hi> to a people, as <hi>Moſes, David,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus the Lord: Or elſe ſecondly, by <hi>eſpecial Deſignation in wrath, for trial and puniſhment</hi> to a people. Thus, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was ſet up by God for <hi>trial</hi> to the ten Tribes, and for puniſhment to <hi>Solomon,</hi> or rather <hi>chaſtiſement,</hi> and <hi>puniſhment</hi> to his ſon <hi>Rehoboam;</hi> ſaith God by his Prophet, <hi>I have given ten Tribes to thee. I will take thee, and thou ſhalt Reign, and ſhalt be King over Iſrael,</hi> 1 King. from 29. to 37. compared with the 12. Chapter, and the 24 verſ.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Saul</hi> was given to the Iſraelites <hi>by God in his anger,</hi> partly for trial, that he might ſee what was in their hearts, and partly for puniſhment, becauſe they <hi>had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Lord from being their King,</hi> nevertheleſſe, <hi>Saul</hi> was a <hi>lawful Higher Power</hi> for a time, although given in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Baaſha was exalted out of the duſt, by God</hi> (as the Lord ſent him word) <hi>and by him made Prince over his people Iſrael,</hi> to fulfill the word of the Lord againſt <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and his houſe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16. Chap. verſ. 2. There are other inſtances, but I proceed.</p>
               <p>In the next place, there are <hi>Higher powers by nature,</hi> that is, they are poſſeſſed, and that juſtly, of the Dignity of Superiority, and of the power of Government, by a <hi>pure, natural Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Higher powers,</hi> are either <hi>Paternal,</hi> or <hi>Patriarchal,</hi> ſuch a right had <hi>Adam,</hi> the Father of all Living, ſo <hi>Noah, Abraham,</hi> and other heads of the houſes of their Fathers, as the Elders of the Iſraelites in Egypt, <hi>Exod.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exo. 3.16.4, 29.</note> 6.14. The <hi>lower powers</hi> in Families, are a <hi>Steward, whom the Houſholder, or Lord of the Family, makes Ruler over his Houſhold to give them their portion of meat in due ſeaſon, as Chriſt</hi> expreſſeth this matter, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.42. ſuch an <hi>inferiour power</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:114655:36"/>was <hi>Eliezer</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> the Steward of <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe; ſo <hi>Tutors and Governors of the Heir, till the time appointed of the Father, are lawful lower powers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Higher powers</hi> are <hi>juſtly</hi> ſuch by a <hi>National Right,</hi> or by the voluntary conſent of thoſe Nations whom they govern, and this, either in <hi>time of peace,</hi> by election or ſucceſſion, as <hi>Judah</hi> did cleave to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> the Son of <hi>Solomon</hi> (and many other Inſtances might be added) or elſe by <hi>victory in a juſt War,</hi> as the Canaanites became Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries, and other people alſo in all ages; And thus the Lord Jeſus himſelf, will be actually <hi>an higher power</hi> by conqueſt of the Nations, <hi>For in Righteouſneſſe be will judge and make war,</hi> Rev. 19.11.</p>
               <p>But to conclude this part of the <hi>Diſtribution;</hi> It is to be noted, that one and the ſame perſon, or the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, may be <hi>lawful higher powers</hi> (by an accumulation of all theſe titles put together) in ſeveral reſpects, after the examples in Scripture, and in other Hiſtories. They may rule over ſome people in the <hi>Authority of God,</hi> over others by the <hi>Title of Natural Right,</hi> over others by <hi>Inheritance,</hi> over others by <hi>Election,</hi> over other people by the <hi>Title</hi> of a <hi>Lawful War,</hi> and all at the ſame time. I could give a good account of this upon principles of Juſtice, and Right Reaſon: But I haſten; and therefore this ſhall ſuffice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Higher powers, lawfully ſuch,</hi> becoming ſo by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or of <hi>Nations,</hi> by Any, or by All of theſe claims before mentioned, or by any other warrantable plea, whatſoever it may be.</p>
               <p>Now concerning thoſe <hi>Higher powers,</hi> who are ſuch <hi>de facto</hi> only, and in <hi>preſent poſſeſsion,</hi> but not <hi>de jure,</hi> or by any <hi>known law of God, or man,</hi> they alſo come under a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters confideration, and have ſeveral heads of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby they may be known.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Higher powers</hi> in being, <hi>without lawful Title and juſt Authority,</hi> ſo to be, and ſo to Rule, are ſuch; firſt of all by <hi>

               <p>I ſhall break off from this work of diſtinguiſhing of <hi>Higher Powers</hi> (for the forms &amp; variations are endleſs) the ſupplanting, and pulling down of each other in a moſt wonderful manner, is repreſented in two chapters moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16. and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.

               <p>Now let the Army prepare themſelves to plead in their own defence, for a moſt ſtrict inquiry will be made, in whoſe Name, and by what Authority they have done, and continue to do all theſe things, which they have done of late dayes againſt the <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Work,</hi> the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> now to be advanced by <hi>Others,</hi> whom God will <hi>chuſe</hi> and <hi>uſe.</hi>

               <p>This for the preſent ſhall ſuffice to the point of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Supremacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for thoſe <hi>who joyn with them</hi> to carry on the work of Juſtice and Mercy, according to the <hi>Indubitable Principles
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114655:38"/>of right Reaſon, and Equity</hi> (which is the other part of the clauſe under conſideration.) By thoſe, I mean, the <hi>Inferior</hi> or <hi>lower Powers,</hi> who comply with the Sword-men in governing the Nations by <hi>new Laws;</hi> and of theſe, I ſay, they are not to be reſiſted
<note n="*" place="margin">That is by particular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, as I mean through out.</note>, doing that which is juſt and right among the people. That is the ſum of the matter in hand.</p>
               <p>Object. It will be ſaid, <hi>This is ſtrange, is not this to</hi> ſpeak contradictions? <hi>to ſpeak ſo ſharply againſt the</hi> Powers <hi>but even now, and now to acknowledge, that they do carry on the works of</hi> Juſtice <hi>and</hi> Mercy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, not ſo in the leaſt; for you ſhall hardly read or hear of any <hi>Powers</hi> (though never ſo wicked and tyrannical in their Government) but at times they were found to do many things good in themſelves, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Principles of Righteouſneſs and Equity, though in other reſpects they were abominable wretches in their governing of the people under them.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, when I wrote this paſſage in my Epiſtle, of <hi>carrying on the works of Juſtice and Mercy,</hi> I particularly thought of their keeping under <hi>that Enemy</hi> which hath been ſo long contended againſt with ſo vaſt expences; and this is the great work of Juſtice upon that party, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, whoſe malice hath been and is inveterate againſt the Saints of the moſt High, whom the Lord would not ever have to riſe up any more to moleſt and perſecute his people. Juſtice upon the wicked, is mercy to the righteous.</p>
               <p>The ſuppreſſing of Theeves and Murtherers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Mercy both; and ſo far as any Powers, <hi>Higher</hi> or <hi>Lower,</hi> do promote theſe works, they are not therein to be reſiſted or hindred. But I ſhall make it plain by two or three Scripture-Inſtances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Avaſhueroſh</hi> made a Feaſt according to his ſtate, <hi>but the drinking was according to the Law,</hi> Eſter 1.8. <hi>None did compel, for the King had appointed to all the Officers of his houſe, that they ſhould do according to every mans pleaſure.</hi> Now in this law and appointment the King was not to be reſiſted;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114655:38"/>But when the ſame King gave the Jews, Gods people, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Hamans</hi> hand,
<note place="margin">Eſter 3.11.</note> 
                  <hi>To do with them as it ſhould ſeem good unto him,</hi> this was to be reſiſted, ſo far as God gave power and oportunity. See the end of the Story; <hi>The Jews fell upon their enemies and deſtroyed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Saul</hi> perſecuted <hi>David</hi> for his life (like a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tyrant as he was) and having almoſt laid hold on him, tidings came, <hi>the Philiſtims had invaded the Land,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 23.27, 28</note> he left <hi>David,</hi> and went to drive out the Enemy; in this he was not to be reſiſted, or oppoſed, it being for publick good, and the eſcape of the Lords ſervant.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Herod,</hi> that <hi>vile Tyrant,</hi> who beheaded <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 6.20</note> yet heard him at ſometimes, and that gladly, and did <hi>many things,</hi> that is, ſuch things as <hi>Johns</hi> Doctrines did direct unto.</p>
               <p>Thus you know my meaning in this alſo, that when I ſpeak of the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> their doing what is in it ſelf morally good, and that we are not to reſiſt them in ſuch actions; yet I do not hereby in the leaſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to be a lawful <hi>Authority,</hi> for there is no ſuch neceſſary connexion betwixt them two, as if, when the <hi>preſent Powers,</hi> at ſome times, in ſome things, happen to do that which in it ſelf is <hi>juſt and right,</hi> therefore it muſt needs follow, that they are a <hi>lawfull Authority,</hi> or <hi>Juſt Power;</hi> for the one is found to be where the other is not.</p>
               <p>As a <hi>lawful Magiſtrate,</hi> in doing wickedly, is to be hindred &amp; prevented, that he bring not ungodly enterprizes to paſs; ſo when any <hi>Tyrant</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> doth that which is <hi>lawful and right,</hi> and according to the plain Principles of Juſtice, (as moſt commonly they do ſomewhat of that kind at certain ſeaſons) herein there is no reaſon of reſiſtance: Yet this is no confirmation of him in his <hi>unjuſt Power;</hi> for there are ſufficient grounds for any, whom the <hi>Lord ſhall annoint</hi> to that work, to take ſuch <hi>Tyrants</hi> off from the face of the earth; notwithſtanding that which hath been ſpoken concerning a private perſons forbearing to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for the hinderance of any good thing performed by them at any time.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:114655:39"/>
               <p>This is all that I intend to ſpeak to the ſecond part of that clauſe, which in this fourth Section was to be explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Onely I think it uſeful,
<note place="margin">Gods end in this ſtrange &amp; unexpected alteration is to be conſidered.</note> that ſome conſideration ſhould be had of the Lords END, in ordering the <hi>Affairs and alterations of this Time and Day,</hi> in ſuch manner, That after all <hi>antient Forms of Government</hi> in this Nation are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, the <hi>Army</hi> ſhould thus take upon them to Rule over the people, good and bad, friends and foes, in like manner, as if we their Brethren had been conquered by them, and ſubdued, as were <hi>our enemies and theirs;</hi> (which to me appears one of the moſt aſtoniſhing providences of theſe laſt fifteen years.) That thoſe who were ſuch a <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing company,</hi> ſuch an <hi>Heavenly people</hi> in their carriage, as if the Head-Quarters had been the very Suburbs of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> at the leaſt; (what a ſound from the Camp in thoſe daies of the <hi>Cauſe of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> of the <hi>deliverance of the Saints,</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom and reign of Chriſt,</hi> of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and multitudes of ſuch phraſes, and Scripture-expreſſions?) I ſay, this is moſt marvellous, to obſerve that theſe things are forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as if they had never been mentioned or talked of in the leaſt. What ſhould be the Lords intent or deſign? what may be the mind and counſel of the Almighty, thus to ſuffer theſe men (after all the goodneſs and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord towards them) to ſet their feet upon the necks of their poor oppreſſed Brethren, that never left them in the leaſt, till they left <hi>Chriſt and his Cauſe to ſink or ſwim;</hi> and then to raiſe up themſelves into this <hi>high</hi> and <hi>mighty honor</hi> of being the <hi>Lords of the Nations,</hi> and their <hi>Iron-Law-givers,</hi> not ſo much as conſulting with their faithful friends, whoſe prayers and counſels they were wont to deſire upon their entrance into great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes?</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Who knows the mind of the Lord? is this ſecret with any of thoſe that fear him? and who walk before him with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although I would not preſume to intrude,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114655:39"/>where I muſt not hope to be admitted, yet, I may give in my apprehenſions in this matter with <hi>ſobriety</hi> and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> to Saints of more intimate acquaintance with the Lord, without offence, and that in a very few words.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Lord may permit theſe things, theſe ſtrange mutations of mens minds, that all the world may ſee, that <hi>marching out of</hi> Egypt, and <hi>entring into</hi> Canaan, are motions very much differing from each other, of 600000 men which came out of the houſe of Bondage, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two ſingle perſons entred into the promiſed Land. Thoſe men who <hi>conquer Ameleck,</hi> dare not <hi>encounter with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nak;</hi> but had rather make a Captain to go back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> than follow God their Leader over <hi>Jordan;</hi> and as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle phraſeth it, <hi>As it was then, even ſo it is now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Another end of Gods leaving this <hi>unhappy new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> and their <hi>unhappy General,</hi> to themſelves and their own hearts luſts, may be this, That the <hi>poor afflicted people,</hi> plainly perceiving that they will not, cannot, do that work which they declared for, might be ſo much the more <hi>importunate with the King of Saints,</hi> to make haſte, and come himſelf, and in the mean time to provide himſelf of new ſervants to carry on that moſt bleſſed Deſign, which his heart is ſet ſo much upon.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That the All-wiſe God may take advantage to <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the precious from the vile,</hi> who being ſo buſie in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and wondering after <hi>this new Image of the Beaſt,</hi> there is a rare oportunity for the <hi>faithful followers of the Lamb,</hi> to leave and depart from thoſe profeſſors, who have now demonſtrated to the world, that they followed Chriſt and his Cauſe for the <hi>loaves,</hi> and not for the <hi>miracles</hi> which he hath done before their eyes.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That having made this <hi>further ſeparation from</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon in the Army and in the Head-Quarters at King <hi>Charls</hi> his Palace; He may <hi>form a peculiar people for himſelf,</hi> to begin where the <hi>New Model</hi> left, even to <hi>pour out thoſe Vials of the wrath of God upon the Antichriſtion State and Seat,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114655:40"/>which are next to be emptied</hi> by thoſe Angels that come out of the Temple.</p>
               <p>But if, Theſe are no part of his end propounded to himſelf in this matter, then I exhort the Saints, who are inquiring into theſe things, to obſerve exactly every ſtep of Providence,
<note place="margin">Finis op ris, Finis operantis.</note> that they may ſee what end the Lord will make, for it is good to underſtand the <hi>end of the action,</hi> if we muſt not know the <hi>end of the Agent,</hi> or <hi>efficient Cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much in reference to the conſideration of thoſe ends which the Lord might propound to himſelf in this ſtrange paſſage of Providence.</p>
               <p>I have not yet finiſhed the explication of this clauſe, There is ſomewhat yet further to be unfolded, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to my Brethren in the Lord, <hi>throughout all the Churches of the Saints, who are ſpirited for Generation-work.</hi> On that I might be <hi>anointed with freſh oyl,</hi> to ſpeak forth to the advantage of the truth and work of Chriſt, what I have received of the Lord! that ſo others might hear and fear, and do no more either ſo <hi>fooliſhly,</hi> or ſo <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly,</hi> as lately they have done.</p>
               <p>But firſt, I muſt premiſe a few words, for a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction thereunto. Thus I apprehend the thing, and thus I expreſſe my mind.</p>
               <p>One part of a Nation, may, for their own ends, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of that perſon, or thoſe perſons, for a ſupreme, or a ſubordinate power, which another part of the people may lawfully refuſe to cloſe withal, or accept for their Rulers, or their Governors, though thereunto required, or otherwiſe attempted by their Brethren.</p>
               <p>There is a famous Inſtance of this, in the 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Zimri,</hi> a Souldier of great command in the Army, but not then General, <hi>conſpired, and ſmote and ſlew the King, and reigned in his ſtead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The people who were incamped againſt <hi>Gibbethon,</hi> hearing hereof, made <hi>Omri the Captain of the hoſt,</hi> (or their General) <hi>King over Iſrael that day in the Camp.</hi> Here was part of the Souldiers had made <hi>Zimri</hi> King, and the greater part, I ſuppoſe, made <hi>Omri</hi> King. But this is not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114655:40"/>that which I intend for my Inſtance, the quarrel being betwixt the Souldiers, in this place. King <hi>Omri</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came King <hi>Zimri,</hi> for they ſhall have that Title (ſeeing the Holy Ghoſt ſaith (of the one and the other) that they did reign, though <hi>Zimri</hi> reigned but ſeven dayes) And then, this is my Inſtance; the people of Iſrael were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two parts, <hi>Half of the people followed</hi> Tibni <hi>the Son of</hi> Ginath <hi>to make him King, and half followed</hi> Omri-Surely the Spirit of God intends ſome inſtruction to us by this punctual Narration of ſuch a matter, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.21.</p>
               <p>I conceive, for my part, that upon Conſiderations which might be offered, they could not impoſe a King upon each other, being equally free; who had the better Title, it is hard to ſay; for the one had as many votes as the other, the people being equally divided. At length <hi>Omri</hi> obtained the Crown; and ſo all muſt conſent, or be ſilent, which in a ſenſe, is as much as conſent for the preſent.</p>
               <p>We may put the caſe thus, Suppoſe half the free people of <hi>England</hi> are for the ſetting up of a <hi>Monarch with a guard of thirty thouſand men to protect him in his Honour and Power;</hi> Suppoſe half the people are for a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> what Law of God or man will juſtifie the firſt half, that have declared for Monarchy, to impoſe upon the other half, who (knowing the manner of all Kings from the infallible Oracles of God) <hi>refuſe to be governed by King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and accordingly declare againſt it? conſidering they are as free as themſelves, who preſume to impoſe, and have more from Scripture, and the Law of the Land, for their rejecting of a King, than the others for imbracing him, eſpecially if impoſed upon them by their Equals, Equals in that point of Freedome. Verily, if a ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable number of the Free-men of <hi>England</hi> (not to mention other Conſiderations) do oppoſe by all Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuch an <hi>Imperious power</hi> from their Brethren inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over them, I do not ſee how any honeſt man can draw a ſword againſt theſe <hi>diſſatisfied Free-men;</hi> and if the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114655:41"/>ſword forbear, I make no queſtion but <hi>Scripture, Law,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> would prevail.</p>
               <p>But it is worthy of Obſervation, That <hi>the Captain of this Hoſt</hi> is not yet advanced ſo far towards the ſetling of this <hi>new Yoke</hi> upon the Nation, as <hi>Omri</hi> was in that, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.22. for <hi>adbuc ſub Judice lis eſt.</hi> And the <hi>Army,</hi> together with their <hi>Partakers, in the late, declared, ſtrange Government,</hi> not having made hitherto a perfect Law according to their own pleaſure and principles, for the ſetling thereof, we wait to ſee, and to know what the Lord will do, and how far he will permit them to march in this dangerous path, for the compaſſing of their ends, who have been the chief Actors and Contrivers in this unparalled, earthly Deſign, to ſay no worſe of it for the preſent.</p>
               <p>But to leave thoſe who have the ſpirits of Free-men (if there be any ſhut up or left) to diſpute with their tongues and pens againſt the <hi>Souldiers Swords,</hi> I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the latitude of my Commiſſion from the Lord Jeſus, and direct my diſcourſe to thoſe people of God, who have openly teſtified, that <hi>the Lord is their Judge, that Jehouab is their Lawgiver, that Jehovah is their King,
<note place="margin">Iſa 33.22.</note> and that he will ſave them,</hi> I mean thoſe Elders and Brethren of the Churches of Chriſt, who have profeſſed to make a compleat and perfect, that is, a total and final ſeparation from the <hi>Mother of Harlots, and from the Beaſt that carries her;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 17.5, 7.</note> and this they have done according to the Counſel and Call of God in the book of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And unto them I ſay, on the behalf of their Lord and mine, Brethren, Ponder the paths of your feet, for every particular ſtep, of every ſeparated Saint in this Nation, ſince the <hi>Twelfth of the Tenth Month,</hi> 1653. hath been, and is of very great moment, and according to their walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſince that day, and hour, when the <hi>Word and Spirit of Jehovah</hi> received ſo high and ſo deſperate an Affront, they may rationally expect extraordinary conſequences for good, or for evill, coming toward them, and remember this, which you now read, is neither Dream nor Fancy,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114655:41"/>although the Rulers of this world will ſo account it, till the God of heaven compel them to change their minds.</p>
               <p>It coſt the Six hundred thouſand very dear (even all that came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 14.</note> who were of twenty years and upwards, yea the righteous as well as the wicked) their making of a Captain to carry them back again to <hi>Egypt,</hi> when an oportunity was offered by God, to paſſe over <hi>Jordan</hi> into the Promiſed Land.</p>
               <p>But let me in brotherly love expoſtulate the caſe with you, for I am, through grace, a fellow-member of the ſame Body. Suppoſe the three Nations generally <hi>WILL</hi> be like the Iſraelites, when they rejected <hi>Jehovah</hi> from being their King, and <hi>WILL</hi> joyn with thoſe earthly-minded men, who ſaid, and proclamed it, Wee <hi>WILL</hi> have a new kind of King to Reign over us, and we <hi>WILL</hi> compel our Brethren by Fire, and Sword, by Jaylors, and High Courts of Injuſtice, to accept of that Monarch whom we have choſen for our ſelves. Will you vote with theſe men, and comply with theſe Apoſtates and Hypocrites? You have given up your names to the Lords Jeſus, <hi>to be a peculiar people unto him,</hi> are you not, or ſhould you not be an <hi>holy Nation</hi> in the midſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? walking in the name of your King, as the men of the world walk in the name of their Monarch? Was it not for your ſakes chiefly, <hi>That Jehovah rebuked Kings and Princes</hi> of late yeers? Is it not for his Sons ſake,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 105.</note> and his Saints ſake, that he hath pulled down the whole ſtructure of the old Government of theſe Nations? yea, he hath ſo ordered things, that the very foundations are deſtroyed, which not long ſince were accounted ſacred, and to the maintenance whereof the people were bound by Oath, and ſolemn League and Covenant, except a few, who fore-ſaw, that God himſelf was ingaged againſt the <hi>Old Heavens,</hi> and the <hi>Old Earth</hi> in theſe Iſlands.</p>
               <p>Were not theſe wonderful changes and deſolations brought forth and finiſhed, when the Officers of the Army, in their own names, created, formed, and ſet up a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114655:42"/>Supreme Power after their own inventions? and then, after ſome few months, (when ſome choice ſpirits were reſolved to proceed in that work, which the <hi>New Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ael</hi> had begun, <hi>viz.</hi> to remove the remaining Rubbiſh of Heatheniſh and Popiſh Cuſtomes, which obſtructed the grand Deſign againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Kings of the earth) did not the Sword-men of that <hi>once famous New Model,</hi> break in peeces, and annihilate their own creation? and that in the ſight of Heaven and Earth, without bluſhing, and then tell the world a <hi>fable</hi> about Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereas no agreement, vote, order, or act paſſed in that Aſſembly to any ſuch purpoſe?</p>
               <p>But I muſt ſigh out this complaint; Very many of thoſe who profeſſe, and pretend to be the Saints of the Moſt High, <hi>have eyes, and ſee not, they have ears, and hear not, they have hearts, and underſtand not</hi> unto this very day; <hi>The veil is upon their hearts in the reading of the Prophecies of the Old,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.14.</note> and the New Teſtament:</hi> And aſſuredly, the Lord hath a great controverſie with many of his own people, becauſe of this, who will find him walking contrary unto them, becauſe they have walked contrary unto him, in this particular. What call from God or man, have we to joyn with the Nations in ſetting up a New Image of worldly Government, eſpecially, at this time of the day, when that which our Anceſtors built, our God hath broken down; and what our Fore-fathers had planted, the Almighty hath plucked up, even the principal Pillars, and Foundations of the former Frame? and is it an imployment worthy of us, to help to repair the Tower of <hi>Babylon</hi> in this Land after theſe Earthquakes? or to heal the deadly wound which the Beaſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? Conſider, doth it become us to help mingle the Iron and the Clay together, that the Image may not want one of its Ten Toes?</p>
               <p>Should you not rather unite with one another, to help conſolidate that <hi>Little ſtone,</hi> which is to <hi>ſmite the Image upon its feet?</hi> And put on the whole Armor of God, that you may be ready at an hours warning, to follow
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114655:42"/>the Lamb, who will ere long appear as the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and make lamentable havock with the <hi>ſcarlet Whore, and the ſcarlet coloured Beaſt</hi> upon which ſhe Rides, whoſe Ten Horns at length, or ſome of them, ſhall be guided to puſh the <hi>mother of the Abominations of the carth</hi> into a Pit of deſtruction, prepared for her by the Lord.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this which hath been ſpoken, would it not be found to be part of our glory and perfection at the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt, to imitate the Apoſtles and Churches of Chriſt in the firſt times, when they were ſo eminently taught of God, in reference to this particular? For when the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake that word of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<note place="margin">Act. 2.40.</note> 
                  <hi>That they ſhould ſave themſelves from this untoward Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;</hi> Aſſuredly he intended not only a ſeparation from the Doctrine, Worſhip, and Government of the Jewiſh Church, but from the State alſo, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; for now they had accepted of the Lord Jeſus as their Prince to govern them, as well as their Saviour to redeem them; it being one of the laſt matters which he gave them in charge before his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28 20.</note> to <hi>teach all his Diſciples to obſerve all things whatſoever he commanded, for all power in heaven and earth was given to him;</hi> and they were not to be <hi>Moſes</hi> his Diſciples henceforward in any thing, and ſo came off from the Government of the Jewiſh Commonwealth. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, when <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of the Magiſtrates to the people, he calls them <hi>their Mogiſtrates,</hi> YOUR RULERS, ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> he doth not ſay <hi>our Rulers,</hi> Act. 3.17. again, when he was, with <hi>John,</hi> convented before Authority, this is his language, <hi>Ye</hi> RULERS OF THE PEOPLE, <hi>and Elders of Iſrael,</hi> he owned them to be <hi>Rulers,</hi> that is, of <hi>the people,</hi> but called them not at any time by any ſuch title, as might ſignifie that they were over them, that is, the Church, as before, when as yet they were of the world; for then indeed they muſt own them as their Rulers, for they had no others to rule them, except the Souldiers. And upon this conſideration, of their being under the government of Chriſt, they did no longer
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114655:43"/>mind what Rulers were ſet up in the world, by the men of the world; thoſe who were Saints by Calling, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, had no heart to buſie themſelves about the choice of a Roman Emperor, though Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> was; but let the Army ſet up whom they pleaſed, and pull down whom they would, it was all one to them. And as for the <hi>Senate of the children of Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 5.22.</note> as we read it, they had little cauſe to chooſe any members for that Parliament, they being looked upon as a company of Sectaries or Separatiſts, and ſo were of <hi>another Company, Communion, and Commonwealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo in like manner <hi>Paul</hi> draws the Saints at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> from the Courts of thoſe higher powers, to compoſe and determine all controverſies among themſelves; for they had better Laws, and might have better Rulers of their own, than any the world had, and then what need they ſeek any further? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. the beginning of the Chap. So that for my part, if I were at liberty, I ſhould be as far from medling in the choice of Knights and Burgeſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>preſent Sword-Sovereignty,</hi> or any other, as from medling in the choice of Arch-biſhops or Biſhops, as they were then called, or of Arch-tryers or Tryers, as they may be now called; and why ſhould not others be of my mind, who have any knowledge of God and his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works in theſe dayes? and ſo never chuſe any more Magiſtrates, till Chriſt, and his Laws, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, come to take place in the Nations. It is a moſt incongruous courſe which ſome Chriſtians have taken, ſince the Lord pulled all in peeces (namely the late Powers) to pray for the ſetting up of the Kingdome of Chriſt in the world, and nevertheleſſe joyn with thoſe who pull down, or prevent that which they ſeem to pray for. But, <hi>let all the Saints and faithful Brethren in Chriſt</hi> throughout this Nation, take heed, they do more ſo much as touch with the Fourth Kingdome, now that the Lord is about <hi>to take away its Deminion, to conſume it utterly, and to deſtroy it to the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:114655:43"/>
               <p>Thus I have endeavored to repreſent at large my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions concerning the <hi>Powers in being,</hi> and I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded, that my Principles, if improved according to their natural tendency, would make notable work among the <hi>Kings of the Earth,</hi> and their under Officers; Oh how would that word of the Lord be fulfilled in <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.
<note place="margin">Jer. 51.58.</note> 
                  <hi>The people would labor in vain towards the intended ſettlement, and the felk ſhould work in the fire, to cauſe the Iron and Clay to ſoder and to incorporate,</hi> and yet do no good upon it, but be wearied out. <hi>Babylon</hi> and her Princes, her Captains and her rich men, her Stateſ-men, and her mighty men, would be tired out with anguiſh and vexation of ſpirit, if the Spirit of the Lord would vouchſafe to aſſiſt us in doing and in ſuffering according to the Will of God in this day.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, I am affraid I ſhall not be underſtood by ſome, in theſe things, although I have endeavored to make out my thoughts with all the plainneſs I could; wherefore I will recollect all in a few words, by the way of diſtinguiſhing one thing from another; Thus,</p>
               <p n="1">1 It is one thing to own the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> according to God, and his directions in the Word of Truth and Rigtheouſneſs; and it is another thing to own them in ſuch a manner, and to ſuch degrees, as they themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and luſt after. The former way I walk in, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall never be found in, by the grace of my God and Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is one thing to own them as <hi>Powers,</hi> and another thing to own them as <hi>lawful and righteous Powers,</hi> the firſt we muſt needs do, for they <hi>have Dominion over our bodies, and over our ſubſtance,</hi> by their <hi>Swords, at their pleaſure;</hi> but to own them as having a right, either by the Law of God or Man, thus to Rule over us, I abſolutely and utterly refuſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Again, It is one thing to own them, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them, as the <hi>Rulers of the people,</hi> when they have univerſally accepted of their iron yokes; and another thing to own and acknowledge them to be <hi>our Governors,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114655:44"/>who never did, nor do ever intend to chuſe or accept them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that new Inſtrument of ſervitude publiſhed to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 It is one thing to own the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> ſo, as not to reſiſt them by force, when they do that which is in it ſelf lawful and right, though they have no lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and it is another thing to own them in their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, perſecutions, all their unrighteous Decrees, and tyrannical practiſes: according to the firſt part of the diſtinction, particular perſons in their private capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities have forborn to interrupt them; but as for he other part, none but baſe Sycophants, and their fellow Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, will therein teſtify their owning of them.</p>
               <p n="5">5 It is one thing to own the worldly and <hi>tyrannical Powers</hi> in the way of <hi>neceſſary ſubjection,</hi> and another to own them out of choyce, and <hi>voluntary Approbation:</hi> The former, Chriſt and his Diſciples have practiſed; but as for the other, none but <hi>ignorant Slaves</hi> have yeelded to it.</p>
               <p>By theſe diſtinctions, and ſuch like, it may eaſily, I conceive, be underſtood, wherein, and in what reſpects I own the <hi>Powers in being,</hi> and in what reſpects, I neither do, nor ever ſhall own them, the Lord continuing to be merciful unto his unworthy ſervant.</p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>Power of the Army,</hi> which I accounted the Supreme, or the higheſt and ſtrongeſt is theſe Iſlands, I do ſtill adhere to my former apprehenſions, that it is ſo, and that they and their partakers have done and may do (while their time laſteth) many things in their own nature juſt and good, yea, good and profitable to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as the ſuppreſſing and puniſhing of Theeves and Murtherers, &amp;c. And in, or for the doing of ſuch things, I do not find any honeſt man riſing up againſt them, but this will not ſignifie in the leaſt, any ſuch thing, as an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of them to be <hi>lawfull Powers,</hi> as I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and as it may be further inſtanced in their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, who though they did many excellent things in their day; yet becauſe they miſcarried in other reſpects,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114655:44"/>the Lord did find them out, and took a convenient time to lay their honor and power in the duſt. Let this ſuffice at preſent, for I muſt now diſpatch this Section.</p>
               <p>There is one <hi>Objection</hi> onely, which poſſibly may lie upon the ſpirits of ſome choyce ſervants of the Lord, and this it is.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Although Chriſt and his Diſciples did ſubmit to the</hi> Higher Powers <hi>in their day, yet it doth not ſeem to be a pattern for us,</hi> upon whom the ends of the world are come. <hi>For firſt, We have reſiſted the Powers in our day, and are blameleſs, in the account of the moſt judicious Teachers which are among us. And Secondly, If we ſhould ſubmit, as they in the primitive times, how could vengeance be executed upon</hi> Babylon <hi>and her Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the Kings of the earth, according to the Prophecies in the Word?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I grant, it is moſt true, there is ground to expect a time, when we ſhall no more be ſubject to the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> and his <hi>little Horn,</hi> which time (you muſt think) thoſe who ſuffer in all Countries, under <hi>Papal, and Regal Tyranny,</hi> do long after, but till that time, you ſee that the <hi>two witneſſes</hi> do ſuffer under the prevailing power of their Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. But for ſatisfaction of thoſe who have not conſidered the matter, <hi>viz.</hi> the different eſtate of the Saints, in different times, It is to be remembred, and well obſerved, That <hi>Jeremy</hi> in the beginning of their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, did by the word of the Lord, direct the Jews, <hi>to ſeek the peace of the City, whither he had cauſed them to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away captives, and to pray unto the Lord for it,
<note place="margin">Jer. 29.7.</note> for in the peace thereof ſhall yee have peace,</hi> Jer. 29.7. But now, if you turn to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.8, 9. you ſhall find there was a time to come, when the Jews ſhould be contrary minded to that paſſage before mentioned; ſaying; <hi>Oh Daughter of</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, <hi>who art to be deſtroyed, happy ſhall he be that rewardeth thee as thou haſt ſerved us. Happy ſhall he be that taketh and daſheth thy little ones againſt the ſtones.</hi> You ſee what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent language and carriage here is, in reference to the ſame City and Power, at different ſeaſons; yea, <hi>Jeremy</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:114655:45"/>himſelf, who ſent word that they ſhould pray for <hi>Babylon,</hi> as you have heard at the beginning of the ſeventy years, ſent another meſſage contrary to it, not long after. I will fix but upon one paſſage or two, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.33. <hi>It is time to threſh</hi> Babylon, <hi>ſaith the Lord, and the time of her harveſt ſhall come.</hi> Again, verſ. 35. <hi>The violence done unto me, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my fleſh, be upon</hi> Babylon, <hi>ſhall the Inhabitant of</hi> Zion <hi>ſay, and my blood be upon the Inhabitants of</hi> Caldea, <hi>ſhall</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſay.</hi> Here is very differing language from the former meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, this cannot be praying for the City, it is no leſs than curſing of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as you plainly ſee; Even thus it is with the true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of the New Teſtament-times, when they were firſt of all perſecuted by the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, they could not prophecy, nor pray for the ruin of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was not the truth and work of that age, and ſo there was neither light nor ſpirit for any ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; but now it is ſeaſonable in this day; and I am perſwaded, if it were poſſible for the Apoſtles to be, and to come among the living Saints in this Nation, who have not defiled their Garments upon the dunghil of this world, nor betrayed the Cauſe of Chriſt wherewith they have been intruſted, they would incourage them to ſpend their arrows, and not ſpare, againſt this myſtical <hi>Babylon;</hi> they would own that cauſe, and work, &amp; truth, for which we indure ſo great oppreſſions and perſecution; and therefore, although I muſt needs be ſubject till the time of deliverance come (and that deliverance ſhall come by Inſtruments annointed of God, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> was, yea, with a better annointing) yet, becauſe by a ſpiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, flowing from that Divine Nature, whereof through rich Grace I do partake, I do know aſſuredly, that we ſhall be ſo far, ere it be long, from <hi>praying for the Powers</hi> under the little Horn, that we ſhall <hi>reward them as they have rewarded us;</hi> Therefore, I ſay, do I thus ſpeak, and thus write, and pray with other enlightened and enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saints; <hi>Pour out the remaining vials of thy wrath, upon the PRESENT POWERS of the Earth, who will not have Chriſt to reign over them; and let all the followers of the Lamb ſay, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>

               <p>Thus I have finiſhed the explanation of the fourth Section of the Epiſtle, with ſuch further manifeſtation of the truth in this point, as for the preſent I am furniſhed withall from the word and Spirit of the Lord, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall paſs on to the next.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. The ſum of what I wrote is this, That the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Martyrs, in all ages (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſince Kings, and ſuch like Arbitrary Powers were over the Saints) <hi>did own the Powers in being</hi> in their daies, and yet at the ſelf ſame time, they <hi>Preached and Prophecied againſt them for their Abominations,</hi> and ſo have I done, and will do, the Lord aſſiſting, according to their examples. This is the ſum of the Anſwer in the Letter.</p>
               <p>Now, I will endeavor to illuſtrate that which ſeems ſo dark to others.</p>
               <p>I begin with <hi>Samuel;</hi> Firſt, He owned <hi>Saul,</hi> as an Higher Power, annointed and appointed of God, to rule over
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:114655:46"/>his people, as you find in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.17. and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.5. in this laſt Chapter you ſhall find theſe words to the people, — <hi>That yee may perceive and ſee, that your wickedneſs is great which yee have done in the ſight of the Lord, in asking you a King;</hi> concluding thus, <hi>If you ſhall ſtill do wickedly, yee ſhall be conſumed, both yee and your King;</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> was preſent all this while, when hee affrighted the people with ſudden thunder and lightning in the time of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, to convince them of their great wickedneſs in ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a King, and might muſe with himſelf, to obſerve how far <hi>Samuel</hi> owned him as a King before the people, and yet at the ſame time he threatned and terrified the people for deſiring him.</p>
               <p>In like manner, after this, though he owned him as the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet what a teſtimony did he bear, from God, againſt him for his hypocriſie, diſobedience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the Lord? and moreover, to the hazard of his life, prophecied or declared that God would reject him, and had rejected him, and would ſet up his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in his ſtead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This inſtance doth ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my principle and practice. But I ſhall not inſiſt ſo largely upon Scripture-inſtances, but put you in mind what I am to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is very poſſible (for it hath been common to many of the Servants of the Lord) for the ſame man at the ſame time to own the Powers in being, and yet to Pray, Preach, or Prophecy againſt them, as if they did not own them. For this, read the hiſtory of the Kings and Chronicles throughout; I ſhall mention but one Inſtance, concerning King <hi>Ahab,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Elijah:</hi> Theſe two met, and this was the Kings ſalutation to the Prophet, <hi>Art thou he that troubleth Iſrael? Elijah</hi> Anſwers him, <hi>I have not troubled</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but Thou and thy Fathers Houſe, in that yee have forſaken the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of Jehovah, and thou haſt followed</hi> Baalim. This was one greeting: Obſerve the next, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.20. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> ſaid to <hi>Elijah, haſt thou found me, Oh mine Enemy?</hi> The Prophet anſwered, <hi>I have found thee, becauſe thou haſt ſold thy ſelf to work evill in the ſight of the Lord;</hi> and ſo he proceeds
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114655:46"/>to prophecy againſt <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebel,</hi> for their murther of <hi>Naboth,</hi> and taking away his Vineyard by oppreſſion, a Prophecy it was of utter deſtruction of the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Daniel,</hi> in dealing ſo plainly with King <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> Chap. 5. from the 18. to the 28 is ſuitable to this point in hand, nothing more clear than this.</p>
               <p>Object. It will be ſaid, <hi>It is undoubtedly true, that the Prophets</hi> did acknowledge the Powers in being, <hi>and yet at the ſame time</hi> did not ſpare them in the leaſt, <hi>either in reſpect of reproofs, or of threatning thoſe plagues and puniſhments which the Lord intended to bring upon them; But what doth this concern us in the New-Teſtament-times, they were annoynted of God to that work, but is that an example for us to walk by who are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> This evaſion is moſt abſurd; for can any rational man imagin, that God, taking ſuch ſpecial care, as it were, not to leave himſelf without ſufficient witneſs againſt the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Higher Powers in thoſe daies, will leave himſelf without witneſs now? can it enter into any ſober mans heart, that the Lord ſhould for above this thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years leave the Rulers, who pretend to be Chriſtian Kings and Princes, to the inclination of their own natures, which are bad enough, and none to reprove or threaten them in the name of the Lord for all their abominable wickedneſſes committed in the ſight of the ſun? no, they ſhall never plead another day, The Kings and Princes of the Jews had Meſſengers and men of God to ſpeak unto them, to turn them from their evil ways, but we had none to preach plainly and boldly againſt our ſins; but if we had known, or it had been told us, that ſuch and ſuch things had provoked the eyes of thy glory, Lord, we ſhould not have perſiſted in the perpetration of them; but our Chaplains and Miniſters were no Prophets, to deal with us as the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> were dealt with; therefore we deſire theſe things may not be imputed to us. No, I ſay, the Lord will cut off all ſuch Pleas and Apologies; For the Lord will tell them, though your
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114655:47"/>Court-Chaplains were ſo baſe and cowardly, as that they would not deal plainly with you, yet there were faithful Servants of mine, who at a convenient diſtance did cry out, becauſe of all your abominations which you did commit, but theſe you perſecuted and baniſhed, and otherwiſe oppreſſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this I know will be returned to ſuch Apologies.</p>
               <p>But yet to gratifie the deſires of ſuch as would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the truth, I ſhall come to the new-Teſtament-times; And firſt, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, did not ſpare <hi>Herod</hi> the King, though he was owned as the <hi>Higher Power</hi> at that time, he could not connive at his Adultery and Inceſt; his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony coſt him his head, as the ſtory is briefly related by the Evangeliſts. But it may be ſome may object, <hi>He was not a Miniſter of the New Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, we will obſerve Chriſts practice in this matter; He owned the <hi>Powers and Rulers,</hi> nevertheleſs, he ſo reproved, threatned, preached and propheſied againſt the Chief Prieſts, the Scribes, and Phariſees (abundance of which Sect were Rulers of the Jews) as that they ſought to lay hands on him from time to time, but the Text ſaith, <hi>they feared the multitude.</hi> His Doctrine did ſingle out the hypocriſie, folly, malice of the Magiſtrates, from the ſins of the multitude; for if Chriſt had never ſo much preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the ſins of the people, the Rulers would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have perſecuted him, who had ſtood up for their intereſt; but you ſhall always find the Doctrine of our Lord did vex and diſturb the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> exceedingly. read the 21. of <hi>Matth.</hi> from the 33. to the end, compared with the ſame Parable in the 12. of <hi>Mark,</hi> and the 20 of <hi>Luke;</hi> Alſo conſider of the tenor of his Doctrine in the 23. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> from the 12. to the end of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>But let us go on to the Apoſtles times; after Chriſt had ſent down the Spirit to furniſh them with gifts for the work of the Miniſtry, more richly than before, <hi>Peter,</hi> in his ſharp words to the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (the Higher Powers are here included) accuſing them of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114655:47"/>moſt abominable wickedneſſe that almoſt could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, expreſſeth himſelf thus, <hi>Him</hi> (meaning the Son of God) <hi>yee have taken, and by</hi> WICKED HANDS HAVE CRUCIFIED AND SLAIN; but more cloſe to the matter in hand, in <hi>Acts</hi> 4. verſ. 8, 9, 10. He owneth the <hi>preſent Powers,</hi> and yet chargeth them with moſt horrible Murther; the Powers charge him and <hi>John</hi> ſtraitly to <hi>ſpeak no more in that Name,</hi> but to forbear; they diſ-own their commands to their faces (though they ſubmit to their <hi>Mittimus</hi> and Gaolers) and tell them, that <hi>God had raiſed up Jeſus,</hi> WHOM YEE SLEW, ſay they, <hi>and hanged on a Tree;</hi> Obſerve how peremptory theſe Goſpel-Miniſters were in refuſing to hearken to their threatnings, there are but few readers obſerve the emphaſis, for the <hi>Jewiſh Powers</hi> were apt to put it off to <hi>Pilate,</hi> for he condemned him, and crucifying was not the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> manner of execution of Malefactors; beſides, they had not power of life and death (for the <hi>Romans</hi> had reſerved that to themſelves, as a peculiar character of the ſupreme Power, and of their abſolute Sovereignty) yet <hi>Peter</hi> chargeth the High Prieſt, and the Council, with the murthering of Chriſt; you may obſerve, how near this accuſation went,
<note place="margin">Act. 5.33.</note> for the Text ſaith, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the hearing of this, they were cut to the heart, and took counſel to ſlay them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, according to the principles and ſpeeches of many <hi>wiſe Engliſh-men, Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> might be thought not to uſe ſo much ſubtilty and diſcretion, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Rulers, whereby they might have kept out of priſon, at leaſtwiſe out of danger of death; for were not they Miniſters of the Goſpel? What need they have ſpoken ſuch words, as muſt needs <hi>provoke the Higher Powers?</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, after they had born their Teſtimony once and again, they might have forborn for the future, ſeeing no good came of it; we in this age have found out a better way of preaching, for we know how to order things ſo, as that if we preach never ſo often before the <hi>Higher powers</hi> guilty of very groſſe wickedneſs (as the word of God, and our conſciences tell us) yet we will not cut them to the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:114655:48"/>heart, as <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> did; we will preach the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, I fear this will appear a real truth when all ſecret things come to be revealed; but as for thouſands of the <hi>Engliſh Parſons and Vicars, and Curates, and State-Lecturers, or Augmentation-men,</hi> I am far from doubting of their compliance with <hi>any Powers</hi> which get the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, its no matter how or which way; inſtead of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing for the <hi>preſent work,</hi> and truth of Chriſt, againſt the <hi>preſent Rulers,</hi> they appear for the <hi>preſent profit,</hi> of their ſeveral and reſpective Benefices, and therefore we muſt not expect they ſhould be followers of the Apoſtles, as they followed Chriſt, in bearing witneſs againſt the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of great and ſmall, without reſpect of perſons.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But yet again, there are others who come with another ridiculous Objection in this manner: Although it be a truth, that the Miniſters of Chriſt, the Prophets, and Apoſtles, &amp;c. were very zealous againſt</hi> the Higher powers, <hi>becauſe of their abominations, yet what they ſpake was to their faces, and not behind their backs, as all the Inſtances given by you do declare; they did not diſgrace or arraign them, as it were, at the Bar of the Vulgar, as you do, and your Fellow-ſufferers; this comes from ſome, who do not well know what to ſay with reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. For anſwer to this, The <hi>Higher Powers</hi> are ſeldome found to ſend for plain-dealing Preachers, to pray or propheſie in their Chapels, or if it happen that they hear them once, its very improbable that they ſhall be ſent for a ſecond time, and then how ſhould the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord declare the Lords Meſſage in their hearing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. We have Inſtances from the Prophets, and Apoſtles in this particular alſo. <hi>Amos</hi> propheſied the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> while he himſelf was abſent; for it may be the King and his Courtiers would not hear <hi>Amos,</hi> who was but a Herdſ-man, and a Gatherer of Sycomore-fruit, yet it was a teſtimony againſt them, though they were abſent whom it moſt concerned; ſo
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114655:48"/>that we Priſoners are not the firſt, who have declared ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching deſtruction to the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Chriſt called <hi>Herod</hi> a <hi>Fox,</hi> or that <hi>Fox;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>Caeſar, Lion,</hi> behind their backs: And why do not our angry Brethren ſay, they might have forborn ſuch kind of language? they not being preſent, at leaſt they ſhould not have called the two <hi>Higheſt Powers</hi> among Jews and Gentiles by the reproachful names of two wild B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſts, and thoſe too, ſuch Beaſts of prey.</p>
               <p>And why do they not find fault with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who in their Sermons to the people had no more good manners, than openly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> guilty of Murther, and the worſe kind of Murther, and this behind their backs, and that in the preſence of Thouſands? See <hi>Acts</hi> 3.17. and <hi>Acts</hi> 13.27, 28. There <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth them in another Country, and amplifieth the matter againſt them.</p>
               <p>But further, in their prayers to God, they named <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> in relating their wicked combination againſt the life of Chriſt. And I know no reaſon why we may not pray and preach after that manner as the firſt Chriſtians did, who I am ſure, were more full of the Holy Spirit then any of us. They were bold and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and whether the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> were abſent or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it was alike <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o them. Certainly open Murther, and open Hypocriſie, and Apoſtacy and Perjury, and Treaſon againſt the King of Glory, muſt be openly and publickly witneſſed againſt before God, Angels, and all the world.</p>
               <p>Shall the <hi>Rulers</hi> be ſo bold, as to commit open abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations before all the people, and ſhall not the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Christ,</hi> who are called thereto, be as bold, and declare as openly againſt thoſe abominations, and that before all the people, whether the guilty ones be in the hearing or not? God forbid, that we ſhould forbear to bear our publick Teſtimony againſt publick wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But others, who underſtand themſelves better than the former ſort of fault-finders, have a greater charge than thoſe before mentioned; for ſay they, <hi>We may upon occaſion declare openly againſt thoſe who ſo ſin, without reſpect of perſons, whether they are preſent or abſent; but what have we, who are miniſters of Chriſt, to do to intermeddle in State-matters or State-Affairs? the compaſs of their Commiſſion will not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them to be</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I perceive plainly, that theſe kinds of Preachings and Diſcourſings have ſuch a <hi>plauſible veri-ſimilitude,</hi> that they are beleeved by many honeſt hearts, to be as true as Goſpel; namely, That thoſe <hi>Ministers</hi> are to be blamed as <hi>too pragmatical,</hi> who inſiſt upon ſuch points, and very worthy to taſte and feel the coercive power of the Civil Magiſtrate; inſomuch, that we are under a very great diſadvantage for the preſent.</p>
               <p>But yet I hope we may be heard to ſpeak for our ſelves, and to plead our Cauſe from Scripture, and from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of right Reaſon, and otherwiſe. Wherefore, let the Queſtion be ſtated thus,</p>

               <p>Before I come to argue and urge the truth in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme, it will be needful and uſeful to explicate the

               <p>Firſt, What is meant by <hi>STATE-AFFAIRS,</hi> or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, Who is to be accounted a <hi>MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt; <hi>State-Affairs,</hi> or matters which concern the State, are, as I conceive, among us to be conſidered in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction to <hi>Church-affairs,</hi> or matters which concern the Church. For that diſtinction of Church and State, being received and kept up, as proper to thoſe parts of the world where there is a <hi>Church-State,</hi> either really or in pretence, it will give us light in this controverſie. But beſides this, that diſtinction of <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> will help us to underſtand this matter more fully, in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. laſt verſe, the <hi>Matters of the Lord,</hi> or of Jehovah, and <hi>the Matters of the King</hi> (the Septuagint reads it thus, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Moreover, the uſual phraſe in the New Teſtament helps us, where it is ſaid, <hi>That you may know my Affairs</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole, we muſt agree to underſtand by that phraſe, <hi>State-Affairs,</hi> thoſe Things or Matters which do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and directly appertain to the Civil Magiſtrate, to take care and cognizance of, and to manage and order for the outward good and welfare of the people, as Wars, Peace, Laws, Cuſtoms, Taxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </gap>) into thoſe things that belong not to us; for a man to thruſt himſelf into buſineſs (<hi>ſeſe ingerere,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> renders it.) It is true, a man may have skil to manage ſuch and ſuch Affairs, but to interpoſe, having no call thereunto, he may be juſtly accounted a <hi>meddleſom pragmatical man,</hi> a <hi>buſie, forward Companion</hi> in ſuch a caſe, and one to whom we uſe to ſay, upbraidingly, <hi>you may meddle with your own matters,</hi> or with your own buſineſs. The Greeks do give this kind of carriage a fit word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, a buſying ones ſelf about many affairs, which yet do not any way concern us; and indeed ſuch a ſpirit is very unbecoming a <hi>Miniſter of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is the property of others, out of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening conceit of their own dexterity and skilfulneſs, to undertake to <hi>meddle with great matters,</hi> or <hi>things too high for them,</hi> or <hi>too wonderful,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.1. of ſuch alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth write, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. They will needs be Teachers of the Law (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) and yet neither underſtand what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm. Surely, it was vain-glory which put them upon ſuch practices. <hi>Salomon</hi> gives this as one character of a fool, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.3. <hi>It is an honor for a man to ceaſe from ſtrife, but every foot will be meddling.</hi> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſome there are, who by reaſon of their <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral temper,</hi> are found to be very much addicted to <hi>meddle with all matters,</hi> and yet good men. It is not ſo much from vain-glory, it is not ſo much from ſelf conceit of their fitneſs to interpoſe in divers buſineſſes, but they have a kind of <hi>Deſultory Genius,</hi> which would be ever and anon leaping from one thing to another; they have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward longing to be doing, &amp; to be meddling, like as ſome men, <hi>who having itching ears, do heap unto themſelves Teachers,</hi> as the Spirit ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. ſo theſe are troubled, as it were with itching fingers, their fingers itch to be meddl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be doing; undoubtedly this is a luſt to be mortified;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114655:50"/>We deſcribe ſuch men, when we ſay proverbially, <hi>They live to have an Oar in every mans Boat,</hi> or in another mans Boat. <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo intimates ſuch a ſpirit in <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.17. <hi>He that paſſeth by and meddleth with ſtrife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the eares;</hi> If he do but paſs by and that upon other buſineſs, (it may be ſerious buſineſs) yet his nature is ſuch, if there be any occaſion, he will be ready to <hi>intermingle</hi> himſelf in the Contention. But I take not the Word in this ſenſe; For this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome corruption in a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> or other Chriſtian, is to be watched and prayed againſt. See 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.10, 11. <hi>We beſeech you, ſaith he — and that ye ſtudy to be quiet, and TO DO YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R OWN B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SINESS.</hi> Yea, <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid almoſt in the ſame words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For a man to do his own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and not to be a Poly-pragmatiſt, (or not to meddle in other mens matters) is one part of Juſtice. Thus I grant, that it may be ſinful to <hi>intermeddle</hi> in ſome caſes, as you have ſeen in theſe three laſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>But yet to <hi>meddle,</hi> or <hi>intermeddle,</hi> is an act which may be taken in a good ſenſe. It is lawfull, yea, a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to intermeddle at ſome ſeaſons, and upon ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; for God and good men may agree to give a man a call, and skill to do thoſe things which ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily he may not meddle withall. Thus <hi>Phineas ſtood up and executed judgement;</hi> It was far from <hi>Phineas</hi> his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to be an <hi>Executioner,</hi> yet he engageth at this time out of his zeal to Juſtice, and againſt moſt horrible wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.30, 31. compared with <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.7. this ſudden act, ſo much out of the way of his calling, is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him for righteouſneſs; yea, to all generations for evermore.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe <hi>Peter</hi> the Fiſher-man, and Fiſher of men, had uſed to preach more than to fight, for he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neither Sword nor Staff about with him, when Chriſt ſent him forth as a Lamb among Wolves; Yet at a certain ſeaſon afterward, he ſo far intermeddled with
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114655:51"/>
                  <hi>State-Affairs,</hi> as that he cut and ſlaſht, till one of the <hi>STATES OFFICERS</hi> had loſt one of his ears, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the number of thoſe who came to apprehend his Maſter.</p>
               <p>Its true, his Office and Imployment was to ſtrike upon the ears of men, as it were, with another kind of ſword, the <hi>two-edged ſword of the Spirit;</hi> but now he had laid that aſide for the preſent; yea, and Chriſt himſelf againſt this juncture of time had bid him <hi>that had never a ſword</hi> (that is, of iron and ſteel) <hi>to ſeel his coat and buy one,</hi> which kind of trading and merchandize, I beleeve, they did not uſe to <hi>meddle</hi> with in former time. Other Inſtances might be given, but I forbear, for theſe were extraordinary caſes, and I ſhall nor urge them.</p>
               <p>But beſide, to <hi>intermeddle</hi> may be taken in a good ſenſe, in that <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.1. <hi>Through deſire a man having ſeparated himſelf, ſeeketh and INTERMEDDLETH with all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> I know <hi>Tremelius</hi> carrieth it in another way; but it is varied in the Margin thus; He that ſeparateth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſeeketh according to his deſire, and <hi>INTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEDDLETH WITH ALL WISDOM.</hi> So the Engliſh Tranſlators. But <hi>Trem.</hi> hath a marginal note, <hi>in omni eſſentia, in every eſſence or being;</hi> It looks ſomething like the character of a grave Philoſopher (ſuch an one as <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi>) who <hi>intermeddles</hi> with all wiſdom, or with <hi>every Eſſence;</hi> yea, its worthy to be weighed, what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks in the perſon of a Preacher, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>I THE PREACHER,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>gave my heart to ſeek and ſearch out by wiſdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all Things that are done under Heaven.</hi> Doth not this expreſſion ſeem ſomewhat like that Proverb of his, laſt mentioned? That which is there called an intermeddling with all Wiſdom, or every Eſſence, ſeems to be in this place of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> called, <hi>A ſearching by Wiſdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all Things that are done under the Sun.</hi> And undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, it is no diſparagement to <hi>Goſpel-Miniſters,</hi> to be <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Philoſophers,</hi> or Lovers of that Wiſdom which is to be found and obtained, by converſing, or inquiring into the word of God, &amp; into the works of God, and therefore their
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:114655:51"/>
                  <hi>intermedling</hi> in all ſuch affairs, from ſuch principles, cannot be interpreted in an evil ſenſe, as if it ſavoured of <hi>pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calneſſe,</hi> or anything like it. This for the interpreting of the ſecond term. And hitherto, I ſuppoſe, I have not ſwerved from the truth in my explications.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt expreſſion is likewiſe to be brought to a fixed concluſion and determination, that we may rightly underſtand the queſtion throughout every part of it; and my meaning in this, <hi>viz.</hi> who are <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel;</hi> I ſhall firſt ſignifie negatively, and then po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Wherefore firſt, I do not intend the <hi>Pontifical</hi> and <hi>Prelatical Clergy,</hi> for from the higheſt Archbiſhop, as ſuch, to the meaneſt Curate, there are none of them whom I look upon under that notion. Although we do know (for we have heard them) that by the help of good natural parts, and their ſuperadded, acquired abilities otherwiſe, namely, by <hi>reading, meditation, imitation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in preaching,</hi> they have excelled many Miniſters of the Goſpel, truly and properly ſo called, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by God and man.</p>
               <p>But, as it is one thing to <hi>ſerve God in the oldneſſe of the letter,</hi> and another, to <hi>ſerve him in the newneſſe of ſpirit,</hi> or the ſpirit; ſo it is frequently found, that a man may be an <hi>able Miniſter of the New Teſtament, according to the letter,</hi> but not <hi>according to the ſpirit, and the miniſtrations thereof.</hi> See the diſtinctions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.</p>
               <p>Divers of theſe Epiſcopal Preachers indeed, did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>intermeddle in State affairs,</hi> for they were Juſtices of Peace, and Privy Counſellors to Kings and Queens, but I never approved of them, or their imployment, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Miniſtry or Magiſtracy, in both which they did <hi>intermeddle</hi> more than they will have thank for, when <hi>they appear before the Judgement ſeat of Jeſus Chriſt, to receive every one according to his works, and what he hath done in the fleſh, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi> So much for theſe, I have done with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Neither ſecondly, do I mean, the <hi>preſent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114655:52"/>Vice-Chancellors, Doctors, Proctors, Heads of Houſes, Deans, Prebends, Cannons,</hi> with the reſt of their Brethren, by what Academical Name or Title ſoever they are dignified or diſtinguiſhed: Although I know likewiſe that many of them, have gifts for the preaching of the Goſpel, and I hope are truly godly.</p>
               <p>But, to ſpeak freely, undoubtedly it would become thoſe of them, who know their Lords will, to take care to do it; for it cannot be denied, that they <hi>ſinfully inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle in the things of the world,</hi> though they pretend to be <hi>married to the Lord</hi> (and ſo are to take <hi>care for the things of the Lord</hi>) This is plain, in regard they have accepted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral worldly Offices and Authorities, which they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe after the <hi>Rudiments of the world,</hi> for they cannot exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe them <hi>according to God or to Chriſt;</hi> for they are none of the <hi>things of Chriſt.</hi> Oh! <hi>that</hi> they are farre from imitating the Apoſtles, and walking in their ſteps, the Lord knows, and we alſo; for they gave over the <hi>ſerving of Tables,</hi> which yet was Church-work, <hi>that they might give themſelves continually to prayer, and to the Miniſtry of the word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore before I go any further, I do publickly bear witneſs on the behalf of the Lord Jeſus, againſt all <hi>that kind of medling in State-affairs,</hi> which doth, in the leaſt, hinder or interrupt the fervants of the Lord in the exerciſe and improvement of that Miniſtry which they have received in the Lord, and for, and from the Lord.</p>
               <p>For let us conſider what the Apoſtles ſay in that place forementioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3. It is not reaſon (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) that we ſhould leave the word of God, and ſerve Tables. A ſentence it is, worthy to be written in letters of gold, yea to be written <hi>with the Spirit of the living God, not in Tables of</hi> (marble) <hi>ſtone, but in fleſpy Tables of the heart.</hi> But, alas! where ſhall we find ſuch a ſpirit among the Miniſters of theſe times? who generally leave the word of God, and do worſe than ſerve Tables, in that ſenſe which the Apoſtles intend, for thy <hi>ſerve,</hi> and <hi>worſhip,</hi> and <hi>wonder</hi> after the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>Beaſt</hi> that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth her, yea and the very Horns of that Beaſt that carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114655:52"/>that Harlot (this is truth, the Lord knows, in whoſe ſight I write theſe things) and yet they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Thouſands will not look like the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel,</hi> when thoſe books, and the book of the New Teſtament ſhall be opened in the ſight of all the world; although now they go under that notion among almoſt all ſorts of people. But enough of theſe alſo for the preſent, let us proceed.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Neither in the third and laſt place, by the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel,</hi> do I here intend, or underſtand, the <hi>Parſens, Vicars, Rectars, Incumbents,</hi> or other ſuch like Miniſters of the Pariſh and Collegiat Churches or Chapels, in this Nation, or any other, or yet any like them, by what new Babyloniſh names and Titles ſoever they are dignified and diſtinguiſhed, according to the known Laws and Cuſtomes of thoſe Lands: For undoubtedly, that old, mouldy, Popiſh Relation, betwixt a Pariſh Miniſter, and his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners, or Pariſh-Church, is of the ſelf-ſame nature, with that which was anciently betwixt the Prior or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, and his Covent, betwixt the Lord Biſhop and his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, betwixt the Dean and his Chapter, and all ſuch like Corporations. I ſay again, and diſprove it who can, or dare, this Pariſh Relation with its appurtenances (which I ſhall treat of in due time, I hope) is of the ſelf-ſame foundation and conſtitution with the others, and equally a ſtranger to the New Teſtament; for the Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>I have, I confeſſe, been ſomewhat large, and that, beyond my firſt intentions, in opening theſe Myſteries of the Man
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114655:53"/>of ſin; but the Lord knows how to improve every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> for the intereſt of our Lord, and to his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing I recommend theſe Explications.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to finiſh this part of my work, I ſay po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, That by <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel,</hi> I underſtand the Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, and Teachers, who are over the true Churches of Chriſt, according to God, which true Churches, were either ſuch as were rightly called out of the world, and ſo formed and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the immediate Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, and the other faithful Miniſters, before the Apoſtacy; Or elſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſuch as are rightly called out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and reſtored, or Re-conſtituted, according to the Primitive Pattern, ſo far as is requiſite for the putting of them in <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> in the former condition. Or thirdly, ſuch, as by <hi>Meſſengers</hi> or <hi>Apoſtles of the Churches</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>And thoſe who are thus over, and in relation to ſuch Churches (among whom Chriſt will delight to walk, that he may transform them from glory to glory by his Word and Spirit) they are the Miniſters whom I mean, and particularly intend in this Queſtion, namely, thoſe who being ſeparated to the Goſpel of God, according to Rule, do accordingly walk before the Lord, and his people, as becomes the Goſpel in all things. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all who own the title of Chriſtians, muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that ſuch as theſe, are to be accounted <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt, and of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things being premiſed for explication, I am now to make out from Scripture, and from principles of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and truth, flowing from expreſſe Scripture, <hi>That it is lawful, in many caſes, for the</hi> TRUE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL <hi>to</hi> MEDDLE <hi>with</hi> STATE-AFFAIRS, or with the matters of the world, as they are diſtinguiſhed from the matters of the Lord, or Church-affairs, with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114655:53"/>thoſe matters which properly belong to the Civ;l Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, namely, the things of this life; and I hope, what I ſhall ſay in this point, may be of ſome uſe to fright away thoſe Bug bears, which are made uſe of, to affright and diſcourage many precious hearts from ſtrengthning the hands of the Lords ſervants in the preſent ſervice of Chriſt, againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Kings of the earth.</p>
               <p>But as I am entring upon this work, that politick fetch of <hi>Paul</hi> (honeſt <hi>Paul,</hi> and it was honeſt policy) when hee made that notable Diviſion among the Phariſees and the Sadduces (<hi>Act.</hi> 23.6.) and ſo much for his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, againſt the injuſtice of the Higher Powers, the High Prieſt and the Council; I ſay, that ſudden Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which he made, comes into my mind; And, in regard that the <hi>Envy, Ill will,</hi> and <hi>Evil-ſpeakings</hi> againſt my perſon, and againſt my practiſe, have broken out at the lips of ſo many Profeſſors, I judge it meet to ſhelter my ſelf under that ſhield and buckler, which Two of the New made Doctors of (School) Divinity, and like <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> had in Reputation among all the people, have made ready to my hand; For certainly, it will bee of ſome uſe for the qualifying of their anger and diſpleaſure, when they underſtand how far they are of the ſame mind with mee in this matter.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, I quote Dr. <hi>Tho. Goodwin,</hi> in the 42. and 43. page of that excellent Sermon of his (worthy of a new Edition, with Additions, in this day) Theſe are his words, and the ſenſe of his words, if I underſtand ſenſe;
<q rend="margQuotes">The Saints have vouchſafed them by God a privilege in RULING and GOVERNING THIS WORLD, and the Providences of God therein; They are <hi>Privy Councellors</hi> to the great King of Kings, who governs all the States and Kingdomes of the world. And God doth give theſe Saints a COMMISSION TO SET UP AND PULL DOWN by their Prayers and Interceſſions. The Old Teſtament ſpeaks in a high language in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.11. —<hi>Concerning the work of my hands command ye me;</hi> who ſpeaks this? the words afore are, <hi>Thus ſaith the Holy One
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114655:54"/>of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. It would have been blaſphemy for us to have ſaid it.—Then he goes on, bringing in the Lord ſpeaking thus, Behold, I that am thus your Maker, give you leave to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> by your prayers, the <hi>great works of my hands,</hi> which concern my children, my ſons; THE AFFAIRS OF KINGDOMS, even ſo far as they relate to their good; the Doctor goes on; And he (God) ſpeaks it upon this occaſion, that for their ſakes he had raiſed up <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and pulled down the <hi>Babylonian Monarchy,</hi> becauſe they by their prayers had ſought this. Thus far the Doctor.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now I cannot diſtinguiſh and judge of the juyce and ſap of words and phraſes in the leaſt, by my Intellectual taſte, or palate, If to rule and govern this world, do not ſuppoſe and ſignifie a medling in the affairs of it; And if Privy Councellors intruſted and authoriſed by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ſet up and pull down, can do either the one or the other, without intermedling in ſuch affairs, I am very much miſtaken. Nay further, he ſaith expreſly, that leave is given them by God, to diſpoſe the works of his hands, the affairs of Kingdoms, even ſo far as they relate to their good, and I judge, no Miniſters of the Goſpel deſire to diſpoſe them otherwiſe than for their good. But ſtill I ſay, they cannot diſpoſe the affairs of Kingdoms, but they muſt meddle with thoſe affairs unavoidably.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>All that can be ſaid by way of Objection or Oppoſition, is this, that the Doctor ſpeaks of Saints, and not of Ministers, and alſo that what is done is by their Prayers and Interceſsions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> All this is readily and eaſily anſwered, as firſt, Miniſters do not loſe the priviledge of Saints, when they are made Miniſters by Chriſt and his people, no more than an other officer of a Church of Saints, doth loſe, or is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the privilege of a member, upon his being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen into office. So that if God gave him this privilege as a Saint, of <hi>ruling, governing, diſpoſing the affairs of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> he may ſtill claim it, and make uſe of his Commiſſion after he is become a Miniſter of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>And as for the ſecond part of the Objection, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he there ſpeaks of <hi>diſpoſing</hi> by prayer and interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114655:54"/>only, but this doth not in the leaſt invalidate my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion; becauſe, <hi>to ſet up, and to pull down, to Govern, Rule, and diſpoſe the world, and the Affairs of Kingdoms,</hi> by prayer, is one way of <hi>meddling with matters of State,</hi> and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent way; Eſpecially, if that Spirit which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the firſt Chriſtians, be but Preſident and predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant among thoſe <hi>privy Councellors,</hi> who meet in Chriſts Name, to ſet up, and to pul down, according to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, for thoſe whom I mentioned, made notable work with that <hi>act of State,</hi> and that <hi>State-policy,</hi> whereby <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> proceeded to murther the Prince of Life. The Faith and Prayers of the faithful remnant, have been in all ages, and will bee henceforward, much more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the Kings of the earth, and their Affairs, than the greateſt quantity of Gunpowder ſet on fire in any Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeen whatſoever, can be to any City or Town, where it is; if once they ſpring a Mine, as I may ſo ſay, they overthrow whatſoever they did undermine, with a more irreſiſtable force, than is imagined or beleeved. For, <hi>eſt quaedam precum omnipotentia,</hi> as he ſaid.</p>
               <p>The true fervent praying againſt States, their Laws and Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is <hi>meddling with a witneſs,</hi> and yet it is hardly known who burts them; but at the laſt day it will be known what execution hath been done upon the Empires and Monarchies of this world, by the Lords people in the ſeveral exigencies of their Affairs; for we know that the Affais of State, Reaſon of State, State-policy, and the Laws of the Land, have above all other things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the deliverance of the choyceſt ſervants of the Lord, from age to age.</p>
               <p>I could illuſtrate this Point of the Miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples meddling by prayer with the <hi>things</hi> and <hi>intereſts</hi> of men, and of the <hi>worldly Powers,</hi> and in ſome meaſure ſhew of what excellent uſe it will be to <hi>overthrow the Thrones of Kingdoms,</hi> &amp;c. But I refer it to the true Miniſters, and the few faithful Brethren in Chriſt, to exerciſe themſelves herein day and night, as, I hear, they begin to do. But let them remember, and not forget upon any terms,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114655:55"/>that Faith is the very life and ſoul of prayer, and if you <hi>meddle</hi> with theſe, or any Powers abroad, without that, you will <hi>meddle</hi> to no purpoſe; But let no man imagin, that becauſe we have not an Anſwer all this while, therefore we are not heard, for Faith waites upon. God for the bringing forth his purpoſes and counſels in his own time; and God forbid wee ſhould <hi>limit the holy one of</hi> Iſrael, or preſcribe to him a method or manner of proceeding, in the production of thoſe antient Decrees, which are to be brought forth in the time appointed of the Father. So much for this firſt way of <hi>meddling with State-Affairs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Doctor of the Divinity aforeſaid, is alſo of great reputation, and therefore, I hope, my adverſaries will not turn away from his Doctrine in this matter. I am bold to call him forth to plead for this Truth, for his Preached and Printed Principles, do very much tend, in my apprehenſion, to the juſtification of the practice of thoſe <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel,</hi> who do or ſhall hereafter <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle in State-Affairs,</hi> as becomes Miniſters; for no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would I have any one to meddle, than as becommeth him, in the judgement of the ſpiritual man.</p>
               <p>There is one notion of his (in the Sermon which I mean) which certainly had the preheminence of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in his mind and judgement, and which I ſhall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe in the firſt place, and then improve it according to its natural tendency, as the Lord ſhall help, on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his own Truth and Intereſt, ſo ſuddenly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily deſerted by thoſe who ſeemed very ſtout Aſſertors of it not many years ago.</p>
               <p>The words of Dr. <hi>O.</hi> in the Serm. on <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.27.</p>
               <p>All the PRESENT STATES OF THE WORLD are cemented together by <hi>Antichriſtian lime,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew afterwards. Unleſs they be ſo ſhaken as to have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very cranny ſearched and bruſhed, they will be no quiet habitation for the Lord Chriſt and his people. This I find in the 14 page.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:114655:55"/>
               <p>Again, in the 25 page I find him ſpeaking to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The <hi>Heavens and the Earth of the Nations,</hi> in their preſent conſtitution, are directly <hi>framed to the intereſt of Antichriſt,</hi> which by notable advantages at their firſt moulding, and continued inſinuations ever ſince, hath ſo riveted it ſelf into the very fundamentals of them, that no digging or mining, without an Earthquake, will caſt up the foundation-ſtones thereof.</p>
               <p>Yet again, to the ſame effect, p. 35. Is it not evident to him that hath but half an eie? that the <hi>whole preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> of the Governments of the Nations, is ſo cemented with <hi>Antichriſtian morter</hi> from the very top to the bottom, that without a <hi>thorough ſhaking</hi> they cannot be cleanſed; And a little after, This onely is certain, It (the ſaid ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king) ſhall not ſtop, nor receive its period, before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>Antichriſtianity</hi> be wholly ſeparated from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of thoſe Nations. Thus far the other Doctor.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Now firſt, We ſee plainly, or may ſee, that he for his part meddles with States and Governments of Nations, all along throughout the Sermon.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He doth particularly declare the nature of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, both foundation and ſuperſtruction; ſhewing alſo how the intereſt of Antichriſt is intermingled or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven in all or moſt of thoſe States in Europe, and that from the top to the bottom.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He declares and foretels the ſhaking, tranſlating, and new molding of all thoſe States and Kingdoms.</p>
               <p n="4">4 He affirms, that every cranny muſt be <hi>ſearched,</hi> for that <hi>Antichriſtian morter</hi> or lime and ſand, which doth cement the conſtitution of the Governments of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that this ſhaking, ſearching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall not ſtop, nor receive a period, till the intereſt of <hi>Antichriſtianity</hi> be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated from theſe Nations.</p>
               <p>From all which, and many other paſſages in that Sermon, I do make this inference, That the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> may lawfully, or without ſin, yea, muſt neceſſarily <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle,</hi> and be imployed in <hi>ſearching into the Affairs of theſe Kingdoms and States.</hi> Yea, further, for ought I can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:114655:56"/>they muſt be imployed by their Lord and Maſter, as the chief laborers, which are to bruſh and clenſe the <hi>States and Governments</hi> from that <hi>Antichriſtian morter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For certainly, it may be eaſily demonſtrated, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains properly to their Office, and as a principal part of it, in theſe laſt times, to diſcover the Man of ſin, to find out Antichriſt in all his ſubterfugies and diverticles, to trace and hunt him in all his windings and turnings; for what ſort and generation of men will the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> and annoint to deal with this great Enemy of Jeſus Chriſts, if not the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel?</hi> And if it be true, that this Doctor hath written elſewhere, (as undoubtedly it is from Scripture-ground) namely, that the Pope hath expreſly bargained for his own intereſt, and provided that that ſhould have the chiefeſt place in all Oaths and Bonds that were betwixt Princes and people, then we muſt look into the Affairs of States, and their Laws and Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and where-ever we find any thing of that Son of perdition, that horned Beaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to detect him, and his legerdemain, and call upon the people of God to help pull down all thoſe things which are of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Beaſt (though it be of the very fundamental conſtitution of the Kingdom and State) which we have detected by the help of the Word and Spirit.</p>
               <p>That Scripture <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. doth expreſs the truth which you have read, in a few excellent words, <hi>Theſe,</hi> ſaith the Spirit, (that is, the Ten Horns or Kings) <hi>have one mind, and will give their power and ſtrength unto the Beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And they, (according to what is prophetically ſpoken) have long fince given their power and ſtrength unto the Beaſt, but we hope it will be taken from the Beaſt ere it be long; but the words of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> by the Spirit, are far more emphatical, than they are rendred by the Kings Tranſlators, I could methinks read them thus, They ſhall deliver up that their Power and Authority unto the Beaſt, <hi>i.e,</hi> that Power which they received, as in the former verſe, <hi>for they received power as Kings one hour with the Beast;</hi> which implies, they received not their <hi>Power</hi> at firſt from the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:114655:56"/>Beaſt; for you ſee, they and the Beaſt came into the world much about a time; but afterward, theſe Kings come to be of one mind, (<gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they give all up, as men do when they paſs away their Lands under hand and ſeal; they were their own Kingdoms, which they gave away; but it may be asked, what folly was this? I anſwer, it was not folly in their opinion, all was for the good of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> the <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi> this was ſuggeſted, and they beleeved it; whereas in truth, theſe Kings fel in league with this <hi>beautiful bold Strumpet,</hi> and committed fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with her, and ſo being intangled in her love, did not regard what coſts they were at to ſatisfie their luſts, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed all they had upon the beaſt that carried her, and all for this drunken Harlots ſake, and for her uſe. Indeed it is wonderful to read and to conſider, how <hi>the Kings of the earth have committed fornication with that great whore of Babylon,</hi> and how <hi>the Nations alſo have been made drunk with the impoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned intexicating wine of her fornications;</hi> for they did always follow the examples of their Kings, or chief Rulers <hi>(Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis ad exemplum)</hi> and how <hi>the Merchants of the earth have
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114655:57"/>waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, in the name of the Lord let this Queſtion be asked; ſhall not the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> (in opening and applying the Scriptures which concern this matter) indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor by all means to <hi>break the league,</hi> betwixt this whoriſh woman and her Lovers, or Paramors, theſe Kings of the earth? Is it not their duty and office to recover the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from their drunkenneſs? who dare forbid the <hi>true Miniſters of Chriſt</hi> to <hi>intermeddle in thoſe Affairs of State,</hi> which are managed for the intereſt of the <hi>great whore that ſitteth upon many waters?</hi> I declare it before the world, we <hi>will meddle</hi> with them more and more, as we grow and increaſe in the knowledge and underſtanding of thoſe Oracles and Prophecies which concern the <hi>ten Horns:</hi> And whether I live or die, let the preſent and approaching Generation know, that <hi>the Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> ſhall be imployed by their Lord, the Prince of the Kings of the earth, as ſome of his principal inſtruments, to pluck up, pull down, and break in peeces the governments of the Nations, for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is got into the bowels; foundations, eſtabliſhments of their powers, and it is our buſineſs, it is our proper work, as you heard, to ſeek him out, and reveal him in the ſight of all the Nations of the earth.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Paſtors and Teachers</hi> (in regard their flocks are to be uſed in the deſtroying of the <hi>Babyloniſh Strumpet</hi>) muſt ſearch every cranny, as the Doctor ſpeaketh; they ſhall to this end be indued with ſuch power, and with ſuch a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from on high, as that in a ſenſe, and in a degree, they ſhall be as exact, accurat and curious, as the Jews uſe to be in ſeeking and ſearching every hole, corner, and cranny of their houſes, for the finding and purging out of the leavened bread, according to that command of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.7. <hi>There ſhall no leavened bread be ſeen with thee, neither ſhall there be leaven ſeen with thee in all thy quarters.</hi> The manner of doing this is ſet down at large by Writers, what care and induſtry was uſed to clear their houſes of the leaven aforeſaid; And as <hi>Paul</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to purge <hi>out the old leaven, that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:114655:57"/>they might be a new lump.</hi> So ſhall the Miniſters of Chriſt, ere long call upon the Nations and Stateſmen therein, to purge out the old leaven of Antichriſtianiſm, yea all the old leaven and the new leaven; and as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, there muſt not be left <hi>a ſtone</hi> of the Babyloniſh building, <hi>For a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor a ſtone for foundations: for Babylon ſhall be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Deſolations,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.26.</p>
               <p>And if it be asked how this ſhall be? the Preacher and Doctor aforeſaid will tell you, and hath told us in part. And I hope I may have liberty to give in my ſenſe alſo, for further explication.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We ſhall reward Babylon as ſhe hath rewarded us.</hi> And among other wayes of recompence, we ſhall by the Spirit and Providence of God, be led and encouraged to go on in prying into every corner with the candle of the Lord. We ſhall look and ſearch narrowly to finde out the <hi>Babyloniſh leaven,</hi> the <hi>Popiſh mixture,</hi> the <hi>Antichriſtian morter,</hi> which is yet remaining in theſe <hi>States and Kingdoms;</hi> for as ſure as the Lord liveth, there is much of all this even in this nation, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe Earthquakes, and wonderful Revolutions. Yea, I will ſay it boldly and truely, the <hi>Relicks of Popery</hi> are maintained and protected by the <hi>preſent Powers.</hi> But to this end that there may an utter extirpation of all thoſe <hi>Popiſh Remaines,</hi> A Glorious, Evangelical inquiſition ſhall be ſet up in due time, and the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> ſhall be <hi>Goſpel-inquiſitors</hi> (I ſpeak in alluſion to the Spaniſh, Popiſh Inquiſition) and then we ſhall have recourſe <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony</hi> (to the Law of God, and to the Teſtimony of Jeſus) and that being the Touchſtone, what we find contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>ſound Doctrine</hi> and <hi>the power of Godlineſs,</hi> contrary to or deſtructive of the liberties and priviledges wherewith Chriſt our Lord, <hi>our Judge, our Law-giver, our King hath made us free,</hi> and endowed us, by thoſe TWO INSTRUMENTS OF HIS GOVERNMENT, and the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of his ſubjects; I ſay we ſhall have recourſe to the word of Chriſt, and what is found oppoſite or contradictory thereto, we ſhall diſcover it and and reveal it openly, as the Lord ſhall give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and Spirit thereunto. When we are once <hi>anointed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114655:58"/>with freſh cile,</hi> for theſe new motions, and expeditions, we ſhall <hi>intermeddle ſo,</hi> as to examine and inquire into the <hi>Oaths and contracts of the State.</hi> We ſhall bring the old known Laws of the Land (made moſt of them when Reaſon, and Religion alſo, were at the loweſt Ebb, when Kings and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments were the Protectors of the Beaſt and Whore) and ſo into the cuſtoms in all Courts of Juſtice and Judicature, of which, though many are faln aſleep, and are rotting in the grave of oblivion, yet others remain alive, and are confirmed by <hi>oath and ſolemn ingagement.</hi> All <hi>Acts of State</hi> will be <hi>med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with;</hi> and the Edicts of the Rulers of the people, brought to the tryal. And let the <hi>Powers</hi> aſſure themſelves, whatſoever Oaths or Branches of Oaths, whatſoever cuſtoms or Relicks of cuſtoms or Traditions they have received from theirs &amp; our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Anceſtors, which have the ſtamp and ſuperſcription of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, or the Man of ſin upon them, and are ſtill underpropped and ſupported by the preſent Commanders and Lords of the Nation, we ſhall in the power of Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and of his Truth and Spirit, ſo far <hi>meddle</hi> with all of them, as that we, our brethren and companions in the Kingdom, the cauſe and the work of Chriſt, ſhall never be ſatisfied or well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed till they are broken all to pieces, ſuppreſſed and conſumed to nothing.</p>
               <p>But leſt, ſome Readers ſhould cenſure me as too peremptory and malapert in my expreſſions; Let us hear what our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor before mentioned ſaith further to this point.</p>
               <p>Although in thoſe paſſages which I have tranſcribed, he ſeems to content himſelf that there ſhould be onely a <hi>ſhaking,</hi> 2 <hi>bruſhing,</hi> and a <hi>cleanſing</hi> of <hi>States and Governments</hi> from the <hi>morter aforeſaid;</hi> Yet in another part of his Sermon, he comes more home to the truth, where he ſaith, that no Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be made for the blood of the Saints ſlain under the Notion of Hereticks, nor Expiation be allowed, whileſt a TOE OF THE IMAGE, OR A BONE OF THE BEAST IS LEFT UNBROKEN. I aſſure you, this is ſomewhat a ſevere expreſſion; this is much more then <hi>bruſhing off the morter and the Cement;</hi> I wiſh he himſelf would fall upon the Image, if it were but upon one of the <hi>little toes of it in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114655:58"/>England,</hi> with the hammer of the World. Would to God, it were the Genius of all the Univerſity-Doctors, to fall upon the <hi>bones of the Beaſt,</hi> as here in the 22 page he doth expreſs himſelf: ſuch a <hi>Bruſh</hi> were as bad as a downright <hi>Blow.</hi> But what if the Lord ſhould eſpie ſome of the moſt forward proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of the Beaſt, in times paſt, and who gave him many a dry Blow, to be turned Artificial Chirurgians, and to be very buſie in healing thoſe deep wounds which were lately made, and very careful to bind up the Bruiſes which the Image recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on ſome of his Ten Toes? the Lords eyes are upon all their wayes, he knows their works and their thoughts; and unto him I refer them for the preſent, without further diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and return from whence I have made this ſhort digreſſion.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters of Chriſt underſtanding this, that no expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be allowed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that yet, they cannot meddle with Antichriſt, nor indeed come at him, or at the Beaſt, and his Horms, but they muſt of neceſſity <hi>meddle with State-affairs</hi> (the Beaſt and the States or ten Horns being ſo neerly related each to other, and making up but one Body politick or Corporation) Let no man imagine that the <hi>zealous faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> will give over or <hi>leave off their medling in State-matters,</hi> becauſe of the Clamors and importune ſuggeſtions of thoſe preachers or profeſſors, <hi>whoſe ſenſes are not exerciſed by reaſon of uſe to diſcern betwixt the good and the evil</hi> in this important point of Goſpel-Truth.</p>
               <p>For, without doubt, As the Paſtors and Teachers, in aſſerting the Prieſtly office of Chriſt, may <hi>lawfully meddle with the Popiſh Prieſthood,</hi> and ſhew the contrariety thereof unto the Scripture, and thereby diſcover the rottenneſs and vileneſs of all thoſe principles which are maintained by them for the uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Affairs of the Papacy,</hi> which concern their Prieſts of all ſorts and ſizes, and their Maſſes, Pilgrimages Purgatory, Proceſſions, and ſuch like ridiculous Inventions, Cuſtoms and Traditions: In like manner there is no queſtion to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong knowing Chriſtians, but in handling the Doctrine of the GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM in the latitude of it, they may interpret and apply all Scriptures of that nature, to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:114655:59"/>the Juſt Diſparagement of the Kings of the Earth (as the Lord conſtantly ſtiles them by that Diminiſhing Title, and of the <hi>Princes of this world, who ſhall come to nothing,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. And, for the better and more effectual advancing of the Name and glory of Chriſt in the world, they may endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to leſſen the eſteem of the <hi>little Horn</hi> and all the Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to it, yea, they may <hi>meddle</hi> ſo far with the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> and their <hi>Acts of State,</hi> or <hi>Statute-Laws,</hi> as to diſcover the <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>unprofitableneſs</hi> thereof in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances of the Lord Jeſus for the Government of the Nations; and if they may <hi>meddle</hi> with thoſe more weighty affaires of the <hi>States and Kingdoms of Europe,</hi> or the <hi>Horns of the Beaſt,</hi> among whom Antichriſt hath ſuch a conſiderable Intereſt; ſurely then, they may <hi>intermeddle</hi> with leſſer and lighter matters of the Government, <hi>viz.</hi> fooliſh and Ridiculous cuſtoms. <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid well, <hi>In Actis publicis nihil lege gravius.</hi> The Laws of a State, are the moſt mighty Acts of State.</p>
               <p>And to this effect, I told the Committee of the New-Court-Council, when they ſpake of my <hi>medling with State-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> as the phraſe is; I told them, I would <hi>meddle with all things</hi> from the beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the end of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi> And I know aſſuredly the word of God medled with all things under the Sun. And therefore I was not to be contracted in my Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>And what I ſaid then, I after ſo many moneths Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confirm publikly, I will <hi>meddle with</hi> every thing which is handled and revealed in the <hi>good word of God,</hi> So far as the Lord by his grace and providence ſhall vouchſafe to give and adminiſter unto ſo unworthy and ſo ſinful a ſervant of his, either light or opportunity; and I will call no man Lord or Maſter upon earth by his aſſiſtance, ſo far, as to ask leave ſo to do; For my Lord is greater then all. And I pity the <hi>preſent power,</hi> becauſe I foreſee, that unleſs the Lord do many marvelous things in mercy to them, they will ſtumble ſo often at that ſtumbling ſtone, as their bruiſes will be very hardly cured. I conclude with this one of D. <hi>O.</hi> Expreſſions; That, ſaith he, which doth and ſhall ſtick upon Potentates to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:114655:59"/>their Ruine, is not ſo much their own or any other Intereſt, as the very <hi>Dreggs of this Papal Antichriſtian Intereſt thruſt into their Oaths and Obligations for no other end in the world, but to keep the Lord Jeſus out of his Throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for that expreſſion, in the Objection; Whatever a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter meddles with, beſides bringing in ſouls to Chriſt, and building them up in Chriſt, It is <hi>beſide the Cuſhion;</hi> I anſwer, I care not, nor my fellow-priſoner, what is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Cuſhion;</hi> We are ſure it is not <hi>beſides the Text,</hi> for a Miniſter to <hi>build up believers in the knowledge of Chriſt.</hi> And, to open thoſe Scriptures, which concern his Kingdom, and <hi>his being King over all the earth,</hi> and to interpret thoſe Oracles, which ſignifie that he will go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern all Nations by his own Laws and Statutes, and not by the <hi>Laws of Omri,</hi> nor the <hi>Statutes and Ordinances of the Houſe of Ahab;</hi> that is, not by the Statutes, Laws, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances or Edicts of the preſent Kings of the earth, The Beaſt and his Ten Horns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is beyond all Controverſie a part of the duty and Office of a Miniſter of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>I anſwer: In the ſelf ſame Language, the Lukewarm gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Miniſters, and conformable Puritans were heard to ſpeak in the times of Prelatical perſecution; and when a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Diſciple complained to another Godly Miniſter, how that faithful ſervant of the Lord, Maſter <hi>Henry Burton</hi> was cruelly handled by his perſecutors, he told him immediately, <hi>He might thank himſelf;</hi> If he had let the Biſhops alone, and the like, they would not have medled with him.</p>
               <p>And as for that great Quarrel againſt us, <hi>that we do not preach the Goſpel,</hi> I have this to ſay, that if we alwayes preach Faith and Repentance, we ſhall be alwayes laying the foundation, and ſo ſhall never go on to perfection: but we know, Though it be not accounted Goſpel in the Courts of Princes, to declare the <hi>glad Tidings of the Kingdom and coming of Chriſt, to put down all rule, all Authority and power,</hi> that the Saints may be at liberty to ſerve the Lord in the full latitude of the New Teſtament-Miniſtration; Yet the <hi>Prince of the Kings of the earth</hi> will account it Goſpel, and preaching of the Goſpel alſo, and this in the preſence of all flattering Court-Chaplains, and of their Maſters alſo, at whoſe Tables they are ſed deliciouſly every day, while their brethren are ſo thruſt into Corners, and unchriſtian and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely uſed and abuſed by them.</p>
               <p>But further, Do they ſtill ſay, <hi>we may thank our ſelves?</hi> We ſay No. We may <hi>thank the God and father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and our Lord Ievus Chriſt himſelf,</hi> that we are <hi>counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame and reproach,</hi> and to be committed to Gaolers for his Truths ſake, and that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe, which once was cryed up by the General and his Army, though now they have gotten a new Cauſe to carry on.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:114655:60"/>
               <p>Again, whereas a great noiſe is made, what LIBERTY we may have to <hi>preach the Goſpel,</hi> what <hi>countenance</hi> and <hi>maintenance;</hi> This I have to return to ſuch Diſcourſes; firſt, I deny that there was or is ſuch <hi>Liberty allowed.</hi> For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will preach the GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOME throughly and effectually, in the <hi>Demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power;</hi> and, whoſoever will zealouſly inſiſt upon thoſe Scriptures, which are profitable for the preſſing of thoſe Doctrines of Truth, which concern the preſent Age and Times, or thoſe which are profitable for reproof, and for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the preſent evils and iniquities of the <hi>higher or lower powers,</hi> they ſhall not enjoy their Liberty Long; but if they are ſuffered, and connived at, it is not becauſe the Rulers are ſatisfied with ſuch Preachers or their Doctrine and Reproofs, but upon other conſiderations, as, either to avoid the Reproachful Imputation of <hi>perſecuting powers,</hi> or elſe becauſe their Inſtrument is but green and Tender, as King <hi>Saul</hi>'s was, when, he did politickly forbear to puniſh thoſe who would not chuſe him for their Lord and King (whereas afterward, when the Kingdom was confirmed to him, he was not ſo modeſt) or upon ſome ſuch profound Reaſons of carnal State-policy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As for their <hi>Countenance and Maintenance,</hi> for my part, I look upon both the one and the other, as two of the ſoreſt and moſt <hi>dangerous ſnares</hi> wherein Miniſters can poſſibly be caught in theſe dayes.</p>
               <p>For is it probable, or indeed poſſible, for any One of the whole Generation of the Parſons and Vicars in the Reformed Churches of Europe; or for the Nurſeries and Seminaries of them (The ſeveral Univerſities in the Reſpective Nations, which did alwayes, and do to this Day, All depend upon the Bounty, Munificence, and Good will of the ſerveral Higher Powers) I ſay, again, How can it be that theſe or ſuch like creatures of mans making, ſhould <hi>turn head</hi> upon their good Lords or bountiful Benefactors, and ſo to bear an high Teſtimony for the Lord Jeſus, againſt the Oppreſſions, Luxuries, ſuperſtitions and other Abominations of the <hi>Princes of the world</hi> aforeſaid? It is not to be imagined or expected. For,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114655:61"/>do rational Men <hi>look for grapes from Thorns, or for figs from Thiſtles?</hi> They were not of Gods planting, and how can they bring forth fruit unto God? But if at any time the Lord himſelf by his own Spirit working in any one of them migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, do call them forth as he did <hi>Paul, Luther</hi> and ſuch like, to bear his name before the Kings of the earth, they muſt caſt up their Reckoning with <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. and come to this concluſion, even <hi>to count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus their Lord;</hi> for whom and whoſe ſervice, they will then willingly count their Benefices, and promotions Eccleſiaſtical (as they call them) their Vice-chancellorſhips, their Headſhips, their Deaneries, their Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, their Univerſity-Degrees, their Augmentations, but Droſs and Dung, that they may promote the work and honor of their Lord.</p>
               <p>For indeed, this is the kindly Operation of the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt. And what <hi>Pariſh-Preacher</hi> ſoever he be who intends to be Chriſts Diſciple in good earneſt (during the time of the Dominion of the little Horn) and to follow him cloſe, ſo as to ſerve him with a perfect heart, He muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily deny himſelf, and forſake his Houſe and (Glebe) Lands; his Tythes and rates for Tythes, whether perſonal or predial, his State-ſalary, or Augmentation, or any other of the fine Things aforeſaid: for otherwiſe he cannot boldly bear up the Teſtimony of Jeſus; nor declare againſt the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Beaſt and the Ten Horns, in all thoſe things wherein they are guilty of High Treaſon againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his Crown and Dignity. But if men will pretend to be for Chriſt, and yet are ſo wiſe as to invent and contrive how to prevent ſufferings for his ſake, let them ſtay behind and keep compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with the world, the world-like Church, and the carnal Clergy; yea let them do as the moſt do, and then the feweſt will laugh them to ſcorn.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid to me, Although you are ſo malapert and ſo bold, to <hi>throw dirt in the faces of ſo many</hi> Reverend Deans, Doctors, Divines, Vice-chancellors, with others of the worſhipful Clergy, and Orthodox Miniſters in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Courts, Cities, and countries in theſe parts of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114655:61"/>world; yet it is not much to be regarded what a prating fool doth ſpeak: beſides. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A prating fool ſhall fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I reply: They will do me manifeſt wrong whoſoever ſhall ſay that <hi>I throw dirt in the faces of theſe men:</hi> for the Truth is this; They have beſmeared their own faces, with groveling upon the Dunghil of the filthy Antichriſtian world, or elſe they have contracted Dirt for want of waſhing and cleanſing their faces and their hands: And I do but tell them where the dirt is, and where the filth ſticks upon them, ſo as that they are and appear very Deformed by reaſon thereof. And if you call me and my fellows prating fools; for ſhewing you where the ſpots of Dirt are to be found, we will be more vile, and we will, by the grace of God, proceed and go on to play the fools, for Chriſts ſake; and that, till, either you turn your backs, and depart with ſhame, or until you are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to look into the glorious glaſs of the New Teſtament, and compare our words with what you finde there repreſented to you: for we will not be out-faced by you in this matter, upon any terms.</p>
               <p>But put the caſe we are ſuch fools as you and your Patrons ſay, and that we talk much more then our ſhare comes to; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks <hi>you ſhould ſuffer fools gladly, ſeeing you your ſelves are ſo wiſe.</hi> And what were it for ſome of you, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your Lord Protector to let out of priſon two or three, or a few fools, to make ſport for the wiſe men at the Court? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, we being ſuch ſimple and contemptible Ignoramuſſes, could not prejudice ſo many wiſe men in any thing we could do or ſay.</p>
               <p>Thus I have indeavoured to anſwer thoſe objections, and to ſpeak ſomething to thoſe reproachful Cavils, which are heard by many, to proceed out of the mouths of Thoſe who uſe to appear like the friends of Chriſt in a Sun-ſhine Day, but to leave him, <hi>when Tribulations or Perſecutions ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the word.</hi> As for the truth, though it cannot be defended by us ſilly, weak worms, as the Lord knows we are, yet, the God of Truth will lift up the Banner of Truth, and it ſhall be diſplayed in ſuch glory at the length, that all Nations ſhall flow unto it.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:114655:62"/>
               <p>The latter part of this Section needs no Explanation, for, <hi>Res ipſa loquitur.</hi> The Thing it ſelf ſpeaketh, and ſpeaketh aloud, ſo that it is heard through the Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Carnal Clergy</hi> have no heart to <hi>declare, or pray, or confeſs,</hi> according to the preſent exigences of the cauſe of our dear Redeemer. But the Counſel of our Lord is plain: <hi>Let them alone, they are blind Leaders of the Blind, and both ſhall fall into the Ditch.</hi> And this ſhall ſuffice for this matter, untill a better Oportunity.</p>

            <head>The Impriſoned Elder, A Servant of the Lord Jeſus, from his Watch-Tower, in this Houſe of Bondage, ſendeth greeting to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which meet together in Warwick Lane, <hi>London.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Well-beloved Brethren in our deareſt Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Deſire earneſtly on your behalf, all, and all maner of Communications of Grace from Heaven, whereby you may <hi>in all Things grow up into him who is the Head, even unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For undoubtedly you having received the Lord Jeſus, as a PRINCE and a SAVIOUR, in the light and power of the glorious Miniſtration of the New Teſtament, cannot but acknowledge, that all your Happineſs is derived from the love of the Father through him, <hi>in whom dwells the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead Bodily,</hi> &amp;c. Now concerning the Things whereof you wrote unto me in your late Letter, This I ſay, and teſtifie in the Lord, for a further Confirmation of the Truth mentioned by you, and for the Encouragement of ſuch honeſt Hearts, who through faith and patience, are in the number of thoſe, which <hi>wait for the kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and for the Conſolation of the true Iſrael,</hi> (for which I am bound with this Chain) That although my Name be caſt out, as vile, &amp; I am ſeparated by the New-faſhion'd King, and his Council from the ſociety of the Saints, (in which, through mercy, I ſo much delighted) yet I bear record be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Congregation, to the praiſe of the Lord, that it is the beſt condition, that I ever taſted of and enjoyed; onely, one ſharp Thorn, which I cannot forget, hath been made uſe of, to keep my ſpirit in a Goſpel-decorum: leſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114655:63"/>otherwiſe, I might have been lifted up above meaſure through that abundance of raviſhing glory, which I have been ready very often to be overwhelmed withal.</p>
            <p>And yet, let the Saints take diligent Heed, that they do not expect much from me, when I am delivered: for it may be, Brethren, Theſe extraordinary viſitations from on High, are intended but for my Priſon-ſtate, and for my ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and ſupport, while I am thus ſuffering from all ſorts of men.</p>
            <p>I have indeed deſired earneſtly that the Spirit of Chriſt may according to his Office, and our Lords promiſe, bring to my remembrance what the Lord hath ſpoken to me, ſince I was Cloſe-Priſoner; and what I have ſeen, and taſted, and heard, and handled of the word of life: for I cannot write it down, though I attempt it. Therefore I beſeech you, let there be prayer made on my behalf, and on your behalf, &amp; which is more, on the Lords behalf, that God would open to me a Door of Utterance, (from that very moment, he ſets open the Priſon-doors) to ſpeak forth that myſtery of Chriſt for which I am in bonds, and that I may make it manifeſt as I ought to ſpeak. And whereas you expect I ſhould offer or propound A way to you, that may be conducible to my Inlargement; I deſire you to underſtand, that it was never in my Heart to direct you what to do, for the obtaining of my Liberty, for it is contrary to that light, and thoſe principles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I walk in this condition. My Judgement is, if there be not Light, and Love, and Courage enough in a Church of Saints, to prompt them to the uſe of Lawful and Honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Means, for the Redemption of their Officer out of Captivity; it is Beſt for him ſtill to lie in Bonds: for it concerns them above all other people to endeavour his deliverance out of the Houſe of Bondage, if they Judge his preſence needful and uſeful in the midſt of them. Alſo, in Anſwer to that Marginal Note in your Epiſtle, I ſhall be plain with you; It is no way proper for me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for the obtaining of my own Liberty in a private way; and rather then do it, I ſhall through the ſtrength of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:114655:64"/>Chriſt, be contented to ſuffer Cloſe-Impriſonment, in this bleſſed Cauſe, during this mans reign, although it ſhould laſt as long as <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s, who uſurped the Chief Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for about the ſpace of twice three yeers and an half.</p>
            <p>It is true, my ſufferings are many and great, and there is a multiplication of Grievances and Injuries, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, and hour of the day. And (as the Chief Captain ſaid) with a Great ſum would I obtain my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, if I were impriſoned upon a Common Account; but as the Caſe ſtands, I ſay again, I ſhall not give place by ſubjection for a moment, or do Any thing more or leſs, that is unworthy of me the Priſoner of the Lord, in ſuch a precious Cauſe as This, (the Lord ſtanding by me, and fully ſtrengthening me) for all the treaſures and riches of the New Court, and of all the Kingdoms of the Earth in to the Bargain.</p>
            <p>And, Brethren, I have reaſon for what I write in this particular: for firſt, the Lord was with me in a moſt ſweet and glorious manner, while I preached thoſe Truths for which I ſuffer. His preſence was alſo with me moſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably from the firſt moment I was apprehended by the Purſevant till I was committed hither; And all this time of my long and wrongful Impriſonment, he hath not left me, nor forſaken me in the leaſt, praiſed for ever be his glorious Name. And ſhould I leave and forſake ſuch a Lord Protector, and ſuch a Comforter, by any baſe Compliance with the Kings of the Earth and their Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites? would not that Spirit be grieved, by which I am ſealed to the day of Redemption? ſhould not the Name of the Lord be blaſphemed? and the faces of the Choiceſt followers of the Lambe gather paleneſs and ſhame? ſurely theſe Conſiderations are prevalent with me. And in this further, I much rejoyce, that I can do nothing againſt the Truth, but for the Truth.</p>
            <p>Beſides the former grounds of not ſtirring or moving for mine own liberty in the ordinary way; I finde not, upon ſearch, that thoſe ſervants of the Lord who were Priſoners and Innocent, did ever petition, or uſe other ordinary
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114655:64"/>means to the Chief Governours for their own Liberty; <hi>Joſeph</hi> did not, <hi>Hanani</hi> did not, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did not, nor <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, nor <hi>Peter,</hi> nor <hi>Paul,</hi> that I can finde.</p>
            <p>And ſurely there is very good reaſon for it, if we could ſearch it out. I conceive theſe which follow, may be given as ſome grounds of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Innocent Priſoners (ſuffering as they did whom I have mentioned) know they have to deal with Tyrants and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Perſecutors; and what will ſuch as theſe hearken to, unleſs the Priſoners do ſubmit to their luſts, and ſatisfie their arbitrary wills and pleaſures?</p>
            <p n="2">2. They glorified God all the while they were ſuffering <hi>Bonds and Impriſonments.</hi> The ſervice of their Maſter was promoted all that time; and being in Gods way, why ſhould they covet to go out of ſo good an Imployment?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Priſoners and Martyrs of the New Teſtament fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>the example of Chriſt, and tread in his ſteps,</hi> when they pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently indure perſecution for the Truths and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake, without making unworthy applications for their liberty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If it becomes us, not to uſe the means and devices of the world to <hi>prevent Impriſonment,</hi> but cheerfully to come when we are ſent for before Kings and Councels for Chriſts ſake and his Goſpels, how unſeemly would it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for us after a ſhort time to uſe means to get out again, after the manner of other men who are in bonds upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accounts?</p>
            <p>I ſhall proceed upon the other part of your Letter the next week, if God permit; and in the mean ſeaſon I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you and exhort you in the Lord, <hi>See that you walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly,</hi> as it is written, <hi>not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the time, becauſe the dayes, in one ſence are very evil. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ye not unwiſe, but underſtanding what the will of the Lord is.</hi>
